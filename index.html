20190403T0502Z: In every moment I start typing a journal entry, or add a pointcode within any code I write, I use the timestamp that occurred the very second I looked at my clock on my laptop.  I only go by Zulu time.  See <a href="https://timestamps.glencooper.com">timestamps.glencooper.com</a> for details.<br>
20190403T0617Z: I've been keeping a journal (in a MediaWiki) at <a href="https://recovery.glencooper.com/">https://recovery.glencooper.com</a> for a long time now.  It's just one problem after another with trying to maintain doing that in a provable way.  I've therefore made the decision to build a subdomain of "trust.glencooper.com" which will be set up with a CNAME DNS record pointing at GlenCooper.github.io.  I've already sent the DNS update to my hosting provider, and am currently awaiting the DNS change to propogate.<br>
20190403T0731Z: yay! looks like the DNS change has propogated: <a href="20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt">20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt</a><br>
20190403T0753Z: my vertigo is now at a 9 out of 10 scale.  I'm going to try to catch some sleep and hope that tomorrow's migraines won't be as unbearable as they've been the last few days.  I'll try to figure out what's going on with the subdomain trust.glencooper.com when I continue this after some sleep.<br>
20190403T0950Z: tried to get some sleep.  Tossed and turned for about an hour.  Was finally drifting off, almost into a deep sleep phase (thanks <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-smart-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8">Sleep Cycle app</a> for the analysis) when I was rudely awoken by a sudden whack of a pillow (or blanket?) by the person who was asleep in the bed next to me, whose name I am purposely omitting at this time, to protect the innocent.  It was an honest mistake.  That's not the point.  The point is; I'm back at the keys, forging onward.<br>
20190403T1039Z: installed <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> for the first time ever.  This line right here is the first time I've ever used the software, and I'm already wildly in love with it.  Goodbye vim and the wacky/problematic colorschemes that go along with it.  Hello <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1048Z: added git and github to atom.  Let's see if commits and pushes are any easier now...?<br>
20190403T1054Z: I need to go lay down for a few minutes.  Atom, you just blew my mind away.  How on earth could I not have found you until now?!  Where have you been all my life?  Thinking of all the time I've wasted wrestling with vim and code without you.  Ugh.  Wow.  Nice!!!  Suberb job, developers of <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1343Z: Got a short bit of sleep in.  Woke with a start, anxious to continue building on this page.  Successfully got the subdomain <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> working, but the https part is not functional yet.  The related Github message says: "Not yet available for your site because the certificate has not finished being issued.  Please allow 24 hours for this process to complete. (trust.glencooper.com)"<br>
20190403T1354Z: worth noting that my vertigo is noticably less after a nap.  I'm now off to battle trying to track down and log into each of my bank accounts to figure out the exact balances on each in order to reapply for food stamps (again!).  FML.<br>
20190403T1358Z: just after committing and pushing that last entry, I reloaded <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> and noticed that it immediately/automatically updated to <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com">https://trust.glencooper.com</a>.  Sweet!<br>
20190403T1416Z: this is what got me going last night on setting up a public journal: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HBsL3hsT9wEo3LvDJy8BO6LVxXQHYob">20190402T2339Z-key_bank_password_reset_FAIL.png</a>.  A little background here: I missed another deadline on the most recent food stamps paperwork.  They wanted Unearned Income Payment Verification.  I tried to log into my first of several bank accounts to get a recent statement, and right off the bat I couldn't remember my first bank's password.  When I tried to do a password reset, I got the SMS text message successfully, but when I put it into their password reset thing on their website, it gave the error message of "We are unable to assist you with unlocking your user ID.  You will need to contact us at 1-800-539-1539".  That's when I decided that I've had enough of wrestling with the banks, trying to prove that I have no money left.... and they won't even let me do that.  Sigh.  I'm about to call that # now.  I will record the call, as I do ALL calls, since I can't remember what is said by the end of the call, or they'll say I remembered what was said incorrectly.  I need proof of every phonecall, and my solution to that is to record every call... for quality and training purposes only, of course.<br>
20190403T1432Z: I despise using phones.  I tried once more to do a password reset.  It worked.  I'm now logged into my <a href="https://www.key.com/">KeyBank</a> bank account.<br>
20190403T1524Z: saw that I recently paid $6.00 for a printed bank statement from my primary checking account at KeyBank.  I did that to test out whether or not USPS was delivering any of my mail here.  Found out USPS was returning all of my mail as "Undeliverable".  Got that sorted with USPS.  Now I need to go back to all of my banks and lawyers to have them resend the stuff that was errorneously returned as Undeliverable.  I called KeyBank and got them to send another printed statement, no charge this time around. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s_-6FPU59ccyxlI2NPIhc77FPX7Ltq2Y">call recorded</a>)<br>
20190403T2326Z: the vertigo won me over today.  It was so bad that I had to lay down.  When I did, I fell asleep.  Woke up hours later, feeling much better.  Checked on my SSDI application status.  It says "Status = Processing".  Continuing on trying to get my bank paperwork together to reapply for food stamps.<br>
20190404T2047Z: Migraines killed my productivity for today.  I stopped taking Advil because I've been dealing with an internal bleeding problem for the last month or so.  I'd rather bury my head in the pillows all day rather than deal with the... well... I will stop going on and on about the gruesome details of my many health issues in this public place.  Let's just say, I am alive, but am currently struggling with ongoing health issues.  I'm pondering ways to break up public vs. private.  I've heard that github has private repositories.  Maybe now would be a good time for me to look into that.<br>
20190405: responded to a cybercoders recruiter via email.  I'll find that and see if I can edit it and upload it here eventually.<br>
20190906T1414Z: TBI-related migraines ongoing, but functional enough to at least update this wiki to say I'm still alive.  Warring with Social Security about them not being able to update an address of mine that appears on their Benefit Verification letter.  It's an address I moved out of over 20 years ago.  I've called them multiple times and even went into a local office in person already requesting they update it.  Each time it's always a different excuse they give why it's still not updated on their website yet.<br>
20190408T013238Z: I added a new button to my bookmarks toolbar in my firefox browser that that I can now just do one click, cut-and-paste, and then instantly have the current iso-8601 timestamp instantly created, and cut-and-pastable to whatever I want. Eventually I hope to make it so that a simple one-click will copy the value to the mouse buffer. The bookmark is linked to <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">timestamp.glencooper.com</a><br>
20190409T055336Z: spent the entire day organizing paperwork for my disability lawyers, and scheduling a doctor appointment with a specialist for an ongoing health issue I've been dealing with over the last month.  Winding down... calling it quits for tonight.  No progress made on anything glencooper.com related... only making this update because I'm super tired now and this is the kind of nonsense I do when I'm deleriously tired.<br>
20190409T171313Z: received a frustrating message from my primary doctor's office that they're unable to open the link that I spent a ton of time on putting together for them yesterday.  I put all of my medical data that I had from when I was in the hospital for 2 months onto 5 DVD ISOs, and made that info available in a single-click Google Drive link... and they say they can't open it.  So apparently they must not have internet access there... yet they're able to correspond to me via their internet-connected website portal... hmm.. re-thinking how to handle this latest drama.<br>
20190409T224144Z: figured out how to get my care summaries from the two hospitals I was in (in Charlottesville).  Got those uploaded to my current primary doctor's portal.<br>
20190410T145302Z: There's no indication that my care summaries were accepted or entered into my online portal with my doctor.  I guess I'll have to make hardcopies and bring them into the doctor's office.<br>
20190410T223820Z: made it to my doctor's office (via Uber).  Asked him to please fill out my SNAPET application for food stamps.  He did.<br>
20190411T060827Z: I'm kinda liking the <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">https://timestamp.glencooper.com</a> bookmark.  I should see how hard it'd be to add a 1-click copy-to-buffer action would be...<br>
20190411T184903Z: wasted too much time trying to get it working to where I could simply one-click something on the page to get it to copy to buffer.<br>
20190412T235119Z: I think my next endeavor will be to build something where I can have a one-answer response to the most common question everyone asks me; "What have you been doing?", or "What do you do all day?".  The problem I have with that is, I don't recall.  I try to only think going forward, not looking back.  If someone wants to know what I've been doing, please don't waste my time asking me questions like that.  Ever since TBI, have a very difficult time remembering things, or some idiot liars will say I don't remember them correctly.  That's why I've chosen github to provably show my history and thought processes.  If you don't understand the things that you read about that I'm spending my time on, that's not my fault that you don't understand.  Learn about things like bitcoin.  Learn about things like <a href="https://lnd.glencooper.com">lnd.glencooper.com</a>.  Learn about things like coding.  Learn to code.  I believe The Lightning Network is going to guarantee that bitcoin (BTC) will always be the #1 cryptocurrency in the world.  I would be a multi-millionaire if I held onto any of the thousands of them I've had over the years instead of buying useless crap with them.<br>
20190413T231816Z: Continuing to struggle with health problems.  Not a whole lot to report on this front, except I have spent a fair amount of time on <a href="https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library">https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library</a> today.  Ran into a problem and need to rethink how this would be possible to maintain security in an open-source fashion.<br>
20190417T035051Z: Hell is real.  I know this because I am living in it right now as I write this.  I've been in it for over two years now.  It will be 3 years exactly on July 22, 2019, see <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">mva.glencooper.com</a>.  I'll never give up trying to code again.  I have yet to succeed.<br>
20190421T062719Z: just adding an update to say that I built (yet another) subdomain: <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>.  The idea behind it is that I have created bitcoin firstbits for several trusted friends and family members, and intend to give them the private keys to those addresses someday.  Of course private keys are meant to be always kept private, so by me having created those BTC firstbits addresses for them, therein lies the trust.  LOL... I just re-read that as I was typing it and chuckled at the absurdity of it all.  Bitcoin has taught me....... [15 minutes elapsed].  I'm tired.  I'm ending this here.<br>
20190421T152817Z: starting to listen to <a href="https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024">https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024</a> right now.  Having just lost half of another of my few remaining molars (while eating a hotdog), I need to shift my mental focus away from my health and dental woes, and see if I can do anything productive.<br>
20190423T024732Z: Sometime recently I threw together a logo for <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>, and captured a snapshot of it in the internet archive at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/</a>.  Within the last 24 hours, I finally received some USPS mail at my current address.  Planning on using that mail as my proof of address until I can get a replacement DMV ID card.  Ordered one with my current address on it months ago, but the USPS returned the mailed ID card to DMV as Undeliverable.  I should follow up with DMV about the updated ID card.<br>
20190518T061905Z: Still struggling here.  Still alive.  Miserable.  I don't tolerate the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HYc3uXpz7Zmsvhw6qveq_9nAIdwx28_l">81% humidity</a> well at all.<br>
20190518T210539Z: I had another problem with USPS again recently.  One of my favorite banks, <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com/">Aspiration</a>, sent me <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16Y1QsanOdD8r5t2NA26f0lIvkcmxMhFr">an email</a> saying that a new debit card that they tried to send me was returned to them.  Before getting that email, I tried to do an EFT transfer from my primary checking to <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a>.  That EFT transfer attempt was returned.  So now I need to waste more precious time dealing with banking woes.<br>
20190519T001104Z: I hate banks.  I just wasted the last 2 hours dealing with the <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a> returned card problem.  (Only members of GlenCooper.com should have security access permissions to allow reading of this data): <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c88ViBm0_uBzE_h2Vl64wSMLnF06txJW/view?usp=sharing">20190518T2359Z-ryan_at_aspiration_sucks.pdf</a>).<br>
20190523T192810Z: The problem with <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a> is believed to be resolved now: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i9TVKImDGUBM-EZcBuxjDmXrfKCa5u1Y">20190521T0032Z-aspiration_ryan_sobered_up.pdf</a><br>
20190602T070805Z: Adding an update here just to say I'm still alive.  That's all there is for good news right now.  I'll skip all of the bad news.<br>
20190716T040531Z: I was deemed Disabled by Social Security definitions as a results of the 2016-07-11 MVA that I was in (see <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com/">mva.glencooper.com</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902022348/https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Rescuers-dispatched-to-serious-crash-on-I-81-387992682.html">mirror1</a>).<br>
20190723T070514Z: the heat index here in Reston, VA has been over 100℉ for a couple days now.<br>
20190725T090037Z: finally the heat wave has broken (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LcMYqtlrPApr7xaYvugbCXysqOqkluEM">20190725T0904Z-weather.png</a>).<br>
20190824T104043Z: My neurologist prescribed Emgality for the frequent migraines that I've been dealing with for a while now.  Omg.  Emgality works.  I've had noticably less severe migraines with a monthly Emgality shot.  I thought to make a short video this time around, and figured out how to work iMovie for the first time ever as well: (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12sq4oMnFuizX8Wg58XuCRt2Bp-owEISh">20190817T1638Z-emgality.mov</a>)<br>
20190831T024417Z: I'm in search of an open-source way to help organize this mess of a journal.  Something at least to make it so someone can quickly check the history by year/month in a calendar-like fashion.  Current price of bitcoin is $9644.12 USD for 1 BTC. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SQ3PEHxR1vMCVb9gWT4e8nJ9eDCAICjF">screenshot</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190831040934/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQ3PEHxR1vMCVb9gWT4e8nJ9eDCAICjF/view">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190902T022613Z: Saw some good friends of mine yesterday: (<a href="https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG">20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902025205/https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190904T082449Z: another recent pic: (<a href="https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG">20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190904083134/https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190906T061958Z: anyone reading this should know that I am literally "slow" now ever since the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">2016-07-22 MVA</a>.  Me typing at all is a difficult task now.  It takes me 1000x average speed to type out a sentence.  I'm still hoping I can code again someday, but there's no way I could handle it yet.  My lack of focus makes it impossible.  At this point, I'm just hoping I can get some sleep.<br>
20190908T050546Z: As I was just randomly surfing, I somehow ended up on <a href="http://www.prettysimpleimages.com/#51">this page</a>, noticed a typo, and immediately stopped surfing, took (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lDRVJ_AAhdobZoqy_l9rqqpofytz9X8B">this screenshot</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190908051941/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDRVJ_AAhdobZoqy_l9rqqpofytz9X8B/view?usp=drive_open">mirror1</a>) with the typo circled in red.  I sent him an email about it from my glen@glencooper.com email.  And yes, I put my real email in this publicly viewable document.  I use gmail for my email, so I trust their spam filters.  Go ahead, spam me.  I dare you.  (In the back of my mind, I'm envisioning "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvEik9N_xWI">I dare ya motherfucker.  I double dare ya</a>").<br>
20190910T074049Z: One of my sons had some anger issues associated with Fortnite, a popular multiplayer game made by EpicGames.com.  I scanned thru their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/tos">T&C</a> and noticed that the page doesn't archive properly at <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a>.  It did get archived properly via <a href="https://archive.today">archive.today</a>: <a href="http://archive.fo/1jvpm">http://archive.fo/1jvpm</a>.  Figured I'd make note of that here for whatever reason.<br>
20190921T234751Z: I heard someone say something about github being purchased by Microsoft.  Somehow I also just happened upon <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-buy-github/">this article in Forbes</a> about it as well.<br>
20190921T235558Z: just for the record, I really dislike Microsoft primarily because I know that they stand no chance in comparison to the open source revolution.  I'd rather not have any of my code in a centralized repository.  I'm therefore now interested in investigating GitLab.<br>
20190922T001508Z: I'm am currently reading <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html">https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html</a>.  For the record, I believe we've reached a Singularity and that is BITCOIN.  The original bitcoin.  BTC.  Every single bitcoin transaction is PERMANENT, and <u>will be FOREVER</u>.  I've long thought that BTC is forever, hence the "[BTC is forever]" in my <a href="https://twitter.com/Crystamped">@Crystamped Twitter account</a>'s username.  I first realized that we've already reached a Singularity was earlier today shortly after I'd watched <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Kzmmclbx8">this Tone Vays YouTube video</a> when it was Live.  I believe bitcoin (BTC) was sent to us by superior intelligence beings not from this earth.  Yes, ET- ExtraTerristrials.  BTC and the LightningNetwork as a second layer scaling solution will decimate the banks and governments that have keps all of us living slaves for all of our life before bitcoin.<br>
20190622T010729Z: currently watching <a href="https://youtu.be/s8DCpG1PeaU">this video on YouTube</a> about the differences between GitHub and GitLab.<br>
20190922T035119Z: reading about <a href="https://medium.com/ci-cd-the-easy-way/how-to-use-git-branches-buddy-to-organize-project-code-sitepoint-e4c36c2d4217">Buddy CI/CD</a><br>
20190929T205117Z: As if junk mail wasn't bad enough, I've been getting a bunch of misdirected email from many different people.  All of the strange emails involve legal issues, so I suspect there's a lawyer Glenn Cooper somewhere and that's who they've meant to email(?).  In trying to do the right thing, I responded to the most recent misdirected email: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1varb8WgljctqZiBOT_2DkyrS8GOrSkHa">20190929T2053Z-misdirected_email.pdf</a><br>
20191003T040643Z: need to reboot.  Adding a note to self here: REMEMBER TO READ & FOLLOW UP ON THE MEDICARE MAIL THAT CAME YESTERDAY<br>
20191011T095353Z: Another wave of migraines and knee problems.  When able to function, my time and attention since the last update has been been completely consumed by <a href="https://bottle.glencooper.com">https://bottle.glencooper,com</a>.<br>
20191013T174146Z: After seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/NighttimeBTC/status/1183434454653657089?s=20">this Tweet</a>, figured I should at least update this.<br>
20191014T231555Z: SSH to my hosting account glencooper.com suddenly stopped working.  It was working constantly since I set it up over a year ago.  I'm positive I didn't do anything which could have suddenly caused it to stop working since I have passwordless logins set up (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Uc9EZtIlvLsZithyqGkgAHksKxunJvHO">screenshot</a>). I'll need to get ahold of hostgator.com's support.<br>
20191014T233016Z: the SSH started working again (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iwbiNAtmRM0syQsSBfrueFmuZvSOE2ni">screenshot</a>).  I haven't touched anything so it must have been something on their end.<br>
20191014T233356Z: SSH is failing again, (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KsYVOCB7peV0YO6cD06Km7cohqH8umal">screenshot</a>).  It's gotta be something on their end.<br>
20191015T074945Z: looks like hostgator finally fixed whatever was wrong.  SSH is working again. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KsYVOCB7peV0YO6cD06Km7cohqH8umal">screenshot</a>)<br>
20191017T034914Z: updating just to update for the hell of it.  Today was a very bad day for me.  One of those crazy days where nothing seemed to go right.  After a couple near psychotic episodes, I finally took a half a klonopin, or chill-pill as I like to call them.  It's working.  I'm calmed down now finally.  Yawning.  Sleep coming soon.<br>
20191022T041233Z: migraines and vertigo out the wazoo since my last update.  Having problems with just about everything online, including archive.org, archive.today, and a bunch of other crap.  Twitter is still going strong... and I happened to see a post on a Mastodon that I tried to archive, couldn't, so am posting it here: <a href="https://bitcoinhackers.org/@bitcoinedu/103003745609063624">https://bitcoinhackers.org/@bitcoinedu/103003745609063624</a>.<br>
20191022T041825Z: hmmm... if I'm in HTML already here... I wonder if I can just do this?:<br>

20191024T083832Z: my migraines have been brutal lately.  It's probably because I started an Emgality trial a while back, but then recently when I went to CVS for a refill, they said the monthly shot is no longer covered under my insurance plan, so they couldn't fill it unless I paid cash for it.  I didn't even ask how much it would cost.  In hindsight, I probably should have.  It doesn't really matter- I don't have any more money left so no matter how much it costs, I wouldn't be able to afford it.  My Medicare should have started by now, but I only received a basic pamplet in the mail about it, no card yet.  I called them two days ago, but slept since, and thanks to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/">TBI</a> in the 2016-07-22 MVA, my memory is completely erased roughly 75% of the nights I sleep, or at other random times.  Today I figured out that I spoke with them a few days ago, but already have no idea what was said on the call whatsoever.  Fortunately, I recorded the call, as I do with all government personnel interactions now.  When I started reviewing the recorded call, I realized that it contains my Social Security number, and other personal info that should not be shared publicly.  I'm therefore trying to figure out if it would be possible to redact or edit the mp3 recording, using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  If anyone reading this happens to have any suggestions, please send me a message via Keybase.  My Keybase contact details are available at <a href="https://keybase.glencooper.com">keybase.glencooper.com</a>.<br>
20191026T232912Z: was.<br>
20191026T212507Z: very dramatic last two days here.  Lucky to still be alive, thought I was going to have a heart attack.  I'm hereby publicly stating that I <s>am </s>was temporarily insane.  I believe it was psychosis related to the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">MVA</a>.  Both times is was brought on by the same thing, but from two different female friends.  On two different days, in completely different enviornments/situations,  I had psychtic episodes where I screamed so loud that I damaged my vocal cords and now have a very hoarse, raspy voice, with burning (but gradually lessening) pain in my throat.  The only thing in common that sparked the two incidents was that the trigger for both was the same: the extremely rude pointing of a finger in my face while bitching about whatever.  I am non-violent.  Always have been.  Always will.  I am afraid that might accidentally change if anyone ever points their finger in my face close enough that I can reach out and break it off.  Knowing how uncontrollable these fits of rage are once they start, I am going to try to carry a stun gun and will use it against any aggressor in a situation where anyone's physical safety or their property is in danger, even if the aggressor is myself (I will zap myself to put myself just to protect others if I am in a psychotic rage).<br>
21091028T084451Z: yesterday I didn't have migraines like usual.  Took advantage of the moment by going to visit my kids.<br>
<span id="20191029T062729Z"></span>20191029T062729Z: somehow I stumbled upon <a href="https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342">this article</a> which intrigued me.  I left a comment on it, and that comment was approved and added to the bottom of the article by the time I fell asleep for a few hours, woke back up just now, and logged back in.  I figured what better place than here to record it.<br>
20191029T100919Z: sudomain <a href="https://carnivore.glencooper.com">carnivore.glencooper.com</a> is now working, via both http and https.  Currently I have it set up to auto-redirect to <a href="https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342">https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342</a>.  Maybe someday I'll change that.  I already tried fasting but quickly realized how little self control I have... I couldn't resist the milky way minis sitting nearby, nor the twix.  Or the Dove dark chocolates.  Ugh.  FML.  Oh well.  Maybe if I had a steak before starting the fast I'll have more willpower.  Maybe next time.<br>
20191030T102940Z: added hyperlink for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/">TBI</a> (earlier in this blog).<br>
20191030T103553Z: my left knee has been very painful lately, moreso than usual.  I've gone thru 3 of the Lidocaine 5% patches already this week, one each day so far.  Probably because I freaked out so violently a few days ago and broke my cane, have been trying to hobble around without it.  I have my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULD5OQ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_xTwUDb0JJ95SN">Hugo Quad Cane</a>, but that thing is embrarrisingly huge, and is heavier than I'd prefer.  The cane I smashed during my last psychotic outbreak was a gift from a friend's father who has passed away, so that cane is irreplacable.  Doh.  Oops.  Damn.  I scare myself when I freak the fuck out.  I've noticed that the high humidity has been a factor every time it has happened.  As long as the power stays on and the dehumidifer stays going, I'm good.  My left knee only bends to 74.5° now.  (I measured: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wZZtqZIB7kpx4yTZAS5Bu08n1eoq0vN_">20191030T064648Z-knee.JPG</a>)<br>
20191030T151244Z: received a new medical insurance card in the mail.  Called CVS to ask that they refill the Emgality shot that they wouldn't give me last time I went because of a problem with the insurance.  Uploaded the new card using CVS app.  Hope this works.  If anyone wants to play a joke on a friend, you can tell them that CVS must have mixed up your phone number with theirs and they left a voicemail on your # by accident, then forward them this: <a href="https://cvs.glencooper.com">cvs.glencooper.com</a><br>
20191031T062921Z: made it to CVS earlier.  When I tried to pick up the Emgality shot, the pharmacist said there was a problem with my insurance.  I had the Medicare printout in hand that had my Medicare number on it, my new UnitedHealthcare Member ID card, and said I just spoke with UnitedHealthcare and my neurologist's office within the last few hours.  She went and made a call, came back and said it was definitely a no go.  I quickly became very frustrated and said I would pay out of pocket for it, no matter the cost.  She said it would cost about $600.<br>
20191101T091903Z I said fine, I'd pay it.  I don't have that much cash, but I have that much credit.  She acted shocked, said they couldn't let me pay that much... there was coupon online that and all I would need to do was get it and give it to them.  There was no cellular service inside the store, and they had no WiFi available.  The only public WiFi signal reachable was a nearby Starbucks, but when I tried to connect to that, it said something like "sorry, we're closed now, try using our WiFi again when we are open".  So I hobbled back outside, in humid enviornment where it was pouring rain.  I know humidity is one of my psychosis triggers.  I lost my shit, recorded myself screaming F*** YOU.  I'm not sure I said F*** YOU Big Pharma, but that's what I meant.  I got back into my friend's car and freaked out some more on her on the way home, saying I couldn't live like this anymore... I had to figure a way out.  It brought her to sobbing tears.<br>
20191101T091931Z: I'm now also fighting a cold, on top of the excruciating migraines.  I feel insane.  I'm trying really hard to NOT grind my teeth or bite down in a dangeously strong sneeeze.  I've been thru 3 boxes of tissues already fighting this beast of a cold.<br>
20191102T204139Z: figured out that CBD tinctures can be used to stave off migraines from reaching unbearable pain.  Thank you CBD.  FU Big Pharma<br>
20191103T215209Z: just got notification that CVS has also cut me off on the anti-depressant medication prescription that I was on.  I sure hope CBD can handle that too.  The way things are going, we might soon find out...

<span id="20191105T065519Z"></span>20191105T065519Z: woke up about 2 hours in excruciating screaming pain with muscle cramps/spasms in my left leg.  Nothing unusual about that, it's pretty much the daily norm since becoming disabled, oh the joys of being disabled.<br>
20191106T182556Z: My recent cold has been kicking my ass, keeping me in bed, busy wrestling with migraines.  Even tho the migraines are tolerable with the CBD, I found that I was still painfully sensitive to light.  Each lightbulb left on for even a second longer than absolutely necessary completely infuritated me.  I am miserable.  Now that I'm up and sitting in front of my laptop, I think I'll try to deal with this: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_g0fKDw7e9MARdBxCr6XYlkMOr4s_kJy">20191106T1823Z-CVS.PNG</a><br>
<span id="20191106T200704Z"></span><a href="https://trust.glencooper.com/?#20191106T200704Z">20191106T200704Z</a>: I just realized that one of my BitPay Visa debit cards had a fraudulent charge appear on it, and that charge was successfully processed.  I'll need to initiate a fraud report with BitPay.  Here's the file I'm planning on sending them, a modified screenshot of the fraudulent charge which I edited and added my own notes to it: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RrHsdnJFKf7p6zXy7bi3lGBkQdSXUO_p">20191106T1928Z-Bitpay9758hacked.PNG</a>.

20191106T203628Z: made a snapshot of https://trust.glencooper.com using archive.org: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191106203536/https://trust.glencooper.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20191106203536/https://trust.glencooper.com/</a><br>
20191107T184441Z: a friend reminded me that I should try to follow up on the BitPay fraud problem.  I received this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P7_fVgnkQPk-Ybf4JrUZVi7pI3FW3cuo">VISA CARDHOLDER DISPUTE FORM.pdf</a> document that was emailed to me after calling BitPay support last night.  I was struggling with trying to figure out how to type in my details in the PDF document.  Finally I figured out that I could upload that PDF to <a href="https://dochub.com/">dochub.com</a> and edit it relatively easily there.  After I'd spent hours on wrestling with their stupid form, I reached <b>SECTION D. Additonal Information to include</b> and got stuck up again on a checkbox for "Police report (if applicable).  Note:  If transaction is unauthorized and the card was in your possession at the time of the unauthorized transaction, please provide a police report or your claim may be denied.", circled in red here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jVBE-u-qZIs_9cWOQk5Lbc0cF41fQshY">20191107T185902Z-screenshot.png</a>.  That's when I looked up the police department number for Long Beach, CA.  I found the phone number for them here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHqiJau0WQjHIRyJpDNd4arCMrige1Tk">20191107T184809Z-long_beach_police_department.png</a><br>
20191107T000657Z: Had another problem with BitPay.  Unable to meet their identity verification processes.  All of my legal mail and bank mail has been errorneously returned to sender for the last year by the USPS which has caused me an insane amount of trouble with any of these identity verification types of things.  Argh.  FML.  I hate banks.  I hate fiat.  I love bitcoin.  I love crypto.<br>
20191108T191331Z: finally finished filling out the incident report for the BitPay9758 fraudulent transaction.  Submitted to <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/Police_FiCOR">Financial Crimes Online Reporting (FiCOR)</a> at the website for Fairfax County Police.  Saved a redacted version of the report that was filed here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L7jRpYfLVk0jYI5cgGE28TgqpliAcEYt">20191108T191101Z-FiCOR--redacted.pdf</a><br>
20191109T181614Z: Completed filling out the VISA CARDHOLDER DISPUTE FORM.pdf document.  Note to self: need to FAX in that signed document.<br>
20191109T212848Z: faxed the complaint form.  took forever to fill out... (I'm SLLLLLOOOOWWWW, THANKS TO THE <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/">TBI</a>)<br>
20191110T123234Z: received an <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WO8Jq4TMYCHTu_CTtYp8AIJ2YMPDqY9X">email</a> from faxzero confirming the FAX was sucessfully transmitted.  Also took this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11pSm19fX9cvFNY1KEAPZeOy7c5wJzRZD">screenshot</a>.<br>
<span id="20191111T160352Z"></span>20191111T160352Z: After seeing <a href="https://gist.github.com/duck1123/1a2d66ff6faaa0120c7c9958ad693725">this gist</a>, I decided to try to make a meme for the first time ever: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KSON0ktiCPTZHHDl-_2T2LIYCHgNO-lz">20191111T154736Z-nutcase.jpg</a><br>
20191113T014642Z: In the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CoJf9Y49ktlArvWajnt3Ba4jmOesDeld">20191112T2205Z-FiCOR_case_number-REDACTED.pdf</a> document, Officer J. Kane Fairfax County Police / Major Crimes Bureau / Financial Crimes Section says "If you provide the credit agencies with the police report number and police contact information, they will upgrade the duration to a 7-year fraud alert.".  Ummm... no thanks.  I've got better things to do.<br>
20191121T064221Z: Had another round of debilitating migraines after that.  Saw my neurologist a couple hours ago, that went great.  I also picked up my meds from CVS, but ended up paying over $200 out-of-pocket for them since my Medicaid was terminated and my Medicare plan didn't cover prescriptions.<br>
20191121T064514Z: I found something that I think might be worth recording here.  I recall having received a couple random misdirected emails recently from individuals sending private/legal/divorce type stuff to me, as if I were a lawyer.  I presumed there must be a Glen Cooper out there that they confused me with.  I never took the time to look... until now... I found this: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TKq7DyY6eL3WVJzsijm3tSTgvRFNR6jn">20191121T063606Z-found_glennecooper.png</a> (screenshot of what I saw at <a href="https://www.glennecooper.com/about/glenn-e-cooper/">https://www.glennecooper.com/about/glenn-e-cooper/</a>).  When I was going to look up the Contact info for Glenn E. Cooper, I immediately saw an error on his webpage: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XtdPXIZTjdWQTfJf3UPuA6l_reNs9xzq">20191121T063703Z-found_error_on_glennecooper_contact_page.png</a>.  Maybe recording this here can prove that I'm at least trying to do the right thing and clear up the misdirected emails.<br>
20191121T071721Z: atom, the code editor I've been using, is now acting all sorts of problematic and uncooperative.  It's probably related to the running-out-of-disk-space problem I'm having in /tmp on 1satoshi.  I'm too tired to deal with that now- there's no easy fix that I'm aware of.  So instead of being able to just update this journal/file/repository using atom like I normally do, I'm instead having to edit the file directly within a browser on the github.com website... groan... I'm going to get some sleep, will deal with this crap tomorrow.<br>
20191122T090052Z: going to try to get a lightning node going again, starting now.<br>
20191122T100324Z: using this as a guide: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dqmbse/how_to_run_your_lighning_node_for_50_000/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dqmbse/how_to_run_your_lighning_node_for_50_000/</a><br>
20191124T172327Z: I just took a bitcoin noob under my wing that I randomly met online.  He says he has zero bitcoin experience, and is only 23, and is "ready to learn".  I started off by suggesting he start at <a href="https://lopp.net/">http://lopp.net</a>.  I've seen nothing but good honest content from Jameson Lopp since the moment I first heard of him about 3 years ago.  That's so rare in the whole crypto world.  The minute I learned that <a href="http://lopp.net/">lopp.net</a> was all open-source, that's when I fired up Atom and knew I had to add a link to Lopp here, in case I ever meet him someday.<br>
20191128T173906Z: Bill Pulte contacted me on Twitter.  I need to get back to him regarding this: <a href="https://archive.ph/Dh3WS">this</a><br>
20191204T042621Z: I just submitted a comment at <a href="https://www.mitchmedical.us/traumatic-brain-injury/neardeath-experiences-ndes.html">https://www.mitchmedical.us/traumatic-brain-injury/neardeath-experiences-ndes.html</a>: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IcjMNcz5BSbD2R5Ymy3fawzTpfr_mOx1">screenshot</a>.<br>
20191207T104911Z: the bitcoin noob that I took under my wing appears to be doing awesome.  I'm convinced that bitcoin is going to dominate the world, and hyperbitcoinization will happen within our lifetime.  There will eventually be two types of peopole in the world: those who hold bitcoin, and those who do not.  Those who know how to securely control their own keys, themselves, and their soverignty.  Bill Pulte just contacted me again regarding the keybase thing.  I just circled back to this point.  I've been trying to find my medical bills, hoping I could lean on him for some help with them in the process of responding... I haven't been able to find any, and would hate to send him an internet bill or something lame like that.  I know there are unpaid medical bills for the doctors that saved my life.  All of that should have been paid by Ann Gibson's car insurance.  Since she's long gone now (she died in the crash), I'm not sure who her insurance company was, or how to even figure out what my bills are... much of my USPS mail has been returned to sender as Undeliverable, according to what I've been able to piece together from many creditcards, banks, and Social Security.  Ugh.  What a mess.<br>
20191207T141621Z: Bill just contacted me again on Twitter.  I need to respond.  Telling myself this... find that Warrant in Debt from Charlottesville.<br>
20191211T041647Z: The last few days since my last update have been brutal.  Migraines and vertigo have been so severe since my last update that I've gone back to using my T-Scope knee brace oonce again whenever hobbling around home.  Woke up today in screaming pain / muscle cramps in legs.  Note to self: I need to get in the habit of uisng a mouthguard again whenever I sleep again so the next time I sleep and wake with leg muscle cramps, I can just grit down instead of screaming aloud and upsetting the neighbors.  To top off the problems with the unbendable knee, I was nauseous to the point having to make sure I had a garbage bag within reach at all times during a 24 hour period in case I vomited.  Probably had some sort of bug or flu.  I would have gotten a flu shot this season if I had any health insurance at all, but right now I think I'm in a gap between Medicaid and Medicare, totally uninsured.  The Medicare Plus package that I've enrolled in will go into effect on January 1, 2020.  I already have an appointment set to see my neurologist on Dec 19th, hoping I can make it until then with the few presriptions I have left.  At least I'm able to type this update.<br>
20191217T064701Z: noticed just now that my 20191211T041647Z update never made it to <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com">trust.glencooper.com</a> properly.  Probably because I didn't do something properly when saving it, staging it, pushing it to the github repository.<br>
20191224T082043Z: Somehow I ended back up here as I was trying to install <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd</a>.  Adding this entry just to say this is where I'm at.<br>
<span id="20191225T002801Z"></span>20191225T002801Z: Merry Christmas to all (except Craig Wright).  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qP8Ol9ZIECFAQRF8c5NlMBKaGKu2NTDk">20190524T235220Z-Merry_Christmas-CryQR.JPG</a><br>
20191226T181829Z: I had plans to see my kids today in the morning.  I went to bed last night where I'd leave my self enough time to get a full 8 hours sleep and still be up at an early enough time to see them.  As luck would have it, my iPhone6's battery is so awful now that it cannot hold a charge over night, even with a fully charged charging pack tucking it in at night.  I remember waking around 8am today, but felt awful, so said "Alexa, set an alarm for 10 minutes" (to the gizmo in the bedroom).  Once I heard it confirm that it set an alarm, I fell back asleep... only to wake 4 hours later- around noon, to find out that my phone was completely powered down and I'd messed up the plans I had to see my kids.  FML.  Ugh.  So awful.  The thing is, when I sleep, I remember NOTHING about where I am, what has happened before I fell asleep.  I am still unanble to even remember a single password over night.  It's been that way ever since the TBI in the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">MVA</a>.  It's not until hours after I wake do I figure out how to get back on track again.  Good news is that I apologized to my x-wife, blamed it on the new meds that my neurologist has me on (Trazodone 100mg), and made plans to see them this evening for dinner.<br>
20191227T171838Z: saw my kids yesterday.  Before leaving home to go see them, I had anoher near-psychotic meltdown when I couldn't find my second shoe.  I found my left shoe; the one that I spent hours on rethreading the laces to accompany my foot-drop brace (my left leg is partially paralyzed from the MVA, so I need to wear a special foot-drop brace whenever I go out in public- it helps me fall over less often).  Eventually I figured out that I could put the foot-drop brace into my slippers and just wear those.  Had dinner at their house.  Amazed at how big they're all getting, omg.  I got some pics, gotta figure out how to organize them and send them to my Mom & Dad...<br>
<span id="20191231T222234Z"></span>20191231T222234Z: Rough times since last update in this repository.  Ubuntu is forcing me to reboot now for some update.  Figured I oughta at least squeeze in this one more update in 2019 in case I forget to reopen this within the next few hours- it'll be 2020, thank God.<br>
20200111T061122Z: Migraines have overbearing since my last update.  I also had another freak-out episode when I stepped in broken glass in the kitchen.  I ended up throwing my cellphone in complete anger and the cellphone broke the TV when it hit the TV's screen.  Already replaced the TV with a comparable one.  Received the raised toilet seat that I ordered.  Gross.  But with an unbendable knee, it's very painful to sit on the toilet without it... you try to sit on a toilet without bending one of your knees, you'll understand.<br>
20200113T055539Z: I'm realizing that I can mentally focus better if I have good music playing, something without a lot of lyrics.  Without that, I'm hopelessly lost in my own mind.  I'm searching for an open-source DJ software, and am about to check out <a href="https://ardour.org/">ardour.org</a>.  If things go well with it, I'll hopefully someday get around to using it to mix up a new <a href="https://glensblend.com/">GlensBlend</a> album.<br>
20200116T092642Z: Changed the location of my KeepassXC database to something that the app installed via snap can easily access.  Now I just gotta figure out how to back up that new file location frequently.<br>
20200116T093334Z: updated this file via web interface intentionally to see what would happen if I started working on an older copy in Atom.  I'm updating this using Atom now.  It didn't see the update I made in the online version.  Hmm...<br>
20200117T042231Z: I received my Medicare documents in the mail (that my doctor's office mailed back to me when my dumbass left at the front desk by accident).<br>
20200121T175450Z: Yesterday I made it to Culpeper, VA to see my neurologist, with the help of a friend who drove me there.  It's quite a haul from here, 58 miles to be exact.  She drives for Uber part-time anyway, so I purchased $200 worth of Uber giftcards at <a href="https://bitrefill.glencooper.com">bitrefill</a> the day before with the intention of paying her via Uber to get me there and back.  After we got in the car, we both turned on our Uber apps.  I hailed an Uber to my destination but the Uber app chose someone else every single time.  We tried it 10 different times throughout our trip, even in remote areas where there would certainly be no other nearby Uber drivers.  Apparently Uber has updated their algotithm that selects the driver; we used this method successfully up until about a month ago.<br>
20200123T123814Z: woke today at sunrise with a migraine.  Decided to give it everything I possibly had to forge ahead and try to document it as it's happening instead of burying my head in the pillows like normal.  To say I'm ornery would be understatement.  I'm in 9/10 pain, having difficulty typing.  I'm noticing that I'm typing primarily with my two index fingers, missing most keys.  Having trouble focusing my eyesight on the words on screen as I type.<br>
20200125T215618Z: wrestling with health problems since last update.  Headache and general joint pain.  It's been rainy and I know the pain is usually worse with the rain.  After being on my feet longer than 10 minutes or so, I get very strange, undescribable electric-like bolts of shooting pain in my legs.  I have been exercising a lot, doing the stretches with my leg and knee.  I just measured how much it's able to bend now.  98°.  I can't remember if that's an improvement, or where I was keeping track of my progress.  I think I'm just going to start using this github repository to track (or maybe I already did, and I'm now repeating myself).<br>
20200131T231151Z: checking out <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up.net</a> - lookin' good from first glance<br>
20200210T004613Z: just found <a href="https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook">https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook</a>, hoping to read that now.<br>
20200211T003050Z: I'm trying to close out my browser tabs and found that on one of them, I'd surfed my way into <a href="https://discourse.sourcecred.io/">https://discourse.sourcecred.io/</a>.  I'm not sure if I'll go back there or not, but figured it was a worthy-enough of an idea to at least earn an entry here.  Maybe someday I'll circle back to it.<br>
20200212T034054Z: Thanks to another migraine today, I've been unable to muster enough mental capacity to code anything or do anything very productive except feed <a href="https://pancho.glencooper.com/">Pancho</a>.  I've been instead poking around with <a href="https://twitter.com/randommandelbot/status/1227344202486337537?s=20">randommandelbot</a> and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.<br>
20200219T193640Z: Migraines have been horrible since my last update.  Yesterday I finally managed to get a refill of Emgality, and took the shot.  Today is the first migraine-free day I've had in as long as I can remember.  As soon as I opened my laptop today, I found myself reading a developmental article that was visible on a new tab within firefox.  The <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-future-of-coding-is-no-code-3fdbd35ac15b">article</a> that instantly grabbed my attention was titled "<i>The Future of Coding Is ‘No Code’</i>".  Before I knew it, I was kicking the tires on this new tool I found called glitch, and threw together <a href="https://helloglitchworld.glitch.me/">https://helloglitchworld.glitch.me/</a> with very little effort.  Making note of it here since this repository has become my dumping ground for these types of random notes.<br>
20200220T042517Z: Trying to set up <a href="https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/wiki/Compiling">Synergy</a> so that I can control two laptops with just one mouse and keyboard.  Right away I found a <a href="https://github.com/GlenCooper/GlenCooper.github.io/blob/master/images/20200220T041832Z-synergy_broken_link.png">broken link</a> on Synergy's webpage.  I'll create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/wiki/Compiling">Synergy repository</a> about it.<br>
20200220T052243Z: Opened <a href="https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/issues/6634">https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/issues/6634</a> for the Synergy broken link problem.<br>
20200222T054633Z: Visited with my kids and x-wife a few hours ago.  I ordered dinner delivery via UberEats from Firehouse Subs.  My vertigo and disequilibrium kicked in hard as I was going to set the delivered subs on the dinner table.  They fell out of the bag and unrolled themselves in such way that it seemed like one of those horrific moments where everything happened in slow motion; As I tried to set the bag on the table, I'd realized I'd missed it, saw the bag go flying thru the air, and watched in dismay as the meatball sub quickly unwrapped itself mid-air, crashing to the kitchen floor completely upside down to the point that one of the meatballs actually escaped and rolled away.  I was borderline hangry, so picked it up and ate it anyway.  Gross or not, I don't care.  I know how I've snapped when hangry before (several times now since the TBI) and didn't want my kids to see that side of me.  I'd rather eat off the floor than throw a psychotic-hissyfit around them, so I did.  It was good.  Thankfully the floor was clean.  No shame in my game.<br>
20200223T030555Z: Note to self: I should look into <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a><br>
20200226T054903Z: Within the last 24 hours, I met someone new online, and helped him set up his first ever bitcoin wallet.  I found him when I was listening to https://di.fm/progressive.  Once we got his <a href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet">open source wallet</a> set up, I sent him a BTC transaction to show my appreciation for his awesome music compilations.  Introducing someone new to the world of bitcoin was the best thing I've done in a very long time.<br>
20200227T093120Z: Yesterday I tried on a NIOSH N95 respirator for the first time ever in preparation for the novel coronavirus COVID19 which has been spreading globally since December 2019.  It's nearly impossible to fit the respirator over my larger than normal nose.  I'll also need to shave my beard if I want it to provide a proper seal around my mouth.  I'm not ready to do that yet, but will if/when the coronavirus outbreak reaches Reston, VA.<br>
20200227T093507Z: I have received notification from OptimaHealth Medicare HMO that they do not cover the medication that I've been taking that helps lessen the migraines that I've been struggling with ever since the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com/">TBI in the 2016 MVA</a>.  I'm going to record the notification here since I suspect someone will say that I didn't try hard enough.  All I do is try.  Every day.  Every minute.  Every second.  I intend to use this repository to show provable timestamps of the constant challenges there are getting anything that helps from Medicare.  I think the whole system is broken and is a fucking waste of time.<br>
20200301T074549Z: I am 84% into my 2nd OMAD fast ever.  Feeling amazing good.  My whole body feels lighter, thoughts clearer.  Slight headche, probably caused by dehydration more than anything else.  I'm trying to remember to drink water, and am, but probably not enough.  I also forgot to mark my body weight before starting the fast.  Oh well, one of these days I'll get it right.<br>
20200319T161040Z: The COVID-19 novel coronavirus is now widespread worldwide.  I just saw on the major news that Italy is now having their military assist with disposing of the dead because they're piling up faster than the funeral system can keep up with.  I wish I could be with my kids, but they're already shelted in place with their Mom.<br>
20200322T200414Z: Currently chatting with <a href="https://keybase.io/swedetoshi">Swedetoshi</a>.  Cool af bitcoin-only dude that I randomly met on CryptoTwitter.  He made me the best stickers I've ever had.<br>
20200322T201805Z: Yesterday I was in my first ever VR presentation.  It was for btcpayserver.  It was awesome!  This is undoubtably the future of all presentations, especially in the era of Social Distancing.  One of these days maybe I'll get a headset.<br>
20200323T224405Z: Just found out that my kids' school has been abruptly ordered closed thru end of year due to the COVID-19 pandemic: <a href="https://archive.fo/4dQ3i">https://archive.fo/4dQ3i</a>.  Whoa.<br>
20200406T004007Z: The COVID-19 pandemic news has consumed nearly all of my time since the last update.  I'm thinking that my partner and I both already contracted the virus back in February.  I don't have any specific times at this point, but I can positively say that we were both so feverish and sick for days that we were literally fearing for our lives.  We both survived it.  It passed within 4-5 days of high fever, chills, and muscle aches.  That was way before the global pandemic started getting out of control in the United States.  Adding this note here now just to at least record the timestamp now.<br>

20200426T152930Z: migraine so severe for the last 8 hours that I wished I was dead<br>
20200503T031932Z: trying to get a lightning network node going by following <a href="https://magazine.odroid.com/article/thundroid-perfect-bitcoin-lightning-node">https://magazine.odroid.com/article/thundroid-perfect-bitcoin-lightning-node/</a><br>
20200521T032546Z: finally got approved by Medicare for the prescripton drug that helps enormously with my migraines.  Thank you, Uncle Sam.  I now have 3 months worth of meds in-hand.  Now if I could just get this fuckin knee to bend (without the extreme pain... which usually brings on nausia from the vertigo, leading to more falls).  I'm 45 years old.  I feel like I'm 90.<br>
20200524T021229Z: I forgot what it was that I started updating this for.  Saw it open on my laptop.  Hmmm...  Anyway, currently trying to see if it would be possible to load Ubuntu on a Chromebook.  Looking for a friend.  I ditched Chromebooks long ago, vowed to never go back.  I'm looking into it for her, although I am kinda curious.<br>
20200524T024954Z: Per <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-chromebook#2-enabling-developer-mode">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-chromebook#2-enabling-developer-mode</a>, you need to put the Chromebook into Developer mode.  Doing so would wipe all data on it currently.  No idea what she's got on it.  I'll try to remember to ask her.<br>
20200527T044217Z: Just started following Jameson Lopp on github (<a href="https://github.com/jlopp">https://github.com/jlopp</a>)<br>
20200611T183026Z: Police brutality protests are going on regularly around the world now after the murder of George Floyd.<br>
20200616T174357Z: the battery on my iPhone 7 quits after about 60 seconds on a call now unless it's plugged in during that call.  Working on trying to get a replacement working so I can call to make a payment on the warrant in debt from the 2016 <a href="http://mva.glencooper.com/">MVA</a>.<br>
20200618T025947Z: was FINALLY able to make a payment by phone for the Warrant in Debt for my $18,570 hospital bill from the MVA.<br>
20200618T043634Z: I'm now using TorGuard VPN and it works well for what it costs.  I tried a dedicated IP with them but had problems with that.  As long as you don't need a dedicated IP, I would recommend them: <a href="https://torguard.glencooper.com">https://torguard.glencooper.com</a>.  Use promo code "1GLENCo" and you'll get 50% off for life.<br>
20200624T004956Z: Saw my neurologist today for a follow-up appointment.  Slightly modified my meds.  Next follow-up is in 3 months from now.<br>
20200707T081554Z: extreme vertigo for the last 24 hours.  I let my prepaid phone plan lapse intentionally.  I'm at a point of nearly giving up.<br>
20200718T091613Z: Often times I've thought about how the government has auctioned off seized bitcoins on more than one occassion, and wondered what they would be worth now had they not.  I just found a website that answers that: <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/us-marshals-bitcoin-auctions/">https://jlopp.github.io/us-marshals-bitcoin-auctions/</a><br>
20200720T221526Z: Just found this very cool thing: <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js">https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js</a>.  Maybe someday I'll figure out how to use it.<br>
20200821T105104Z: Yesterday was a bad day.  I decided it was finally time to upgrade my main laptop from Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04.  I did a full backup first.  Followed the upgrade steps.  Rebooted.  Now I am unable to log into my profile on it; it only goes to a blank screen.  I am able to unlock the encrypted drive upon boot, and see the screen that gives a multiple choice of which profile to log into, but after entering my password on my profile, the screen goes solid black and stays that way for hours until I finally reboot, try again, same thing.  On top of losing access to my primary laptop profile, I had a migraine that kept me in bed most of the day.  Today I was still feeling like dogshit, so thought I oughta take my temperature.  Yikes.  I'm running a fever.  Since I am now locked out of my primary profile, I am going to use this space to record my temperature readings here so I don't lose them or get my dates mixed up.  A few hours ago, around 20200821T070000Z when I first took my temp, I was 109.9.  A half hour later, around 20200821T073000Z, I was 101.0.<br>
20200821T110428Z: Current temp ear reading is 100.3°F.  Tried to find a place to get a COVID-19 test but had no luck.  Saw on the news that CVS is now offering testing for no charge.  Tried to book an appointmnet but they said none available today, tomorrow or 3 days from now.<br>
20200821T115017Z: Current temp ear reading is 100.3°F<br>
20200821T143030Z: 101.1°F sweating<br>
20200821T150016Z: 100.5°F sitting in front of fan high speed<br>
20200822T005019Z: 100.3°F just waking up from 8 hour sleep<br>
20200822T020155Z: 100.1°F<br>
20200822T024933Z: 100.1°F.  Started taking a round of Amoxicillin 500mg because I also have an abscess in my mouth from a failed root canal 20 years ago.  That abscess is puffing up, which it does every time I have an infection.  Already had two apicoectomies; still the same... now I just use the abscess as my indicator for when I need to start a round of antibiotics.<br>
20200822T035113Z: 100.4°F<br>
20200822T045003Z: 101.5°F, in bed, fatigue<br>
20200822T192920Z: 98.6°F, fever broke, going to sleep now<br>
20200823T090412Z: 99.0°F<br>
20200823T190445Z: 98.7°F.  Was able to schedule a COVID-19 test at CVS for Tuesday August 25, 2020 at 11:10am EDT.<br>
20200825T122844Z: 99.2°F.  Getting ready to go get COVID-19 test today.<br>
20200829T203849Z: Haven't had a fever since it broke on August 22.  Received <a href="MyChart%20-%20Test%20Details.pdf">COVID-19 test results</a> today.  Test results = Negative for COVID-19.<br>
20200909T221643Z: Spoke with my kids on a FaceTime call yesterday.  During the call, I said to my youngest, "you have a birthday coming up soon, right?".  He said it already passed.  I lost track of the date and feel awful about it, said I would get him an extra gift when I see him next.<br>
20200909T221856Z: Recording this here sine I don't know where else to record it.  I've been having the strangest phantom pains for a very long time, too many to list.  Adding the latest because it's totally bizarre; my big toe on my right foot feels like it's frozen.  It's been that way for 3 days now.  It makes no sense.  While the big toe feels frozen, the bottom of that foot and the other toes feel like there is cold air blowing on them.  There certainly is not.  I tried putting thick winter socks on just to see if it would change things.  It didn't.  I don't know what to make of it.  I just hope it goes away soon.  OUCH.  As I was about to end this entry, I just got an awful feeling of having stepped on a nail with my right foot, and that hot nail went painfully through my foot, bottom to top.  I think I better go look up the signs of diabetes or some kind of explanation for this.<br>
20200927T220751Z: figured out that the strange phantom pains were all related to my left knee problem.  When I bend the knee as far as I possibly can, the pain associated with doing that shoots the random pains.  I could be stretching my knee and where you think there would be knee pain, I get a sharp mind-piercing pain in my head, right around the area that the hospital drilled a hole in my skull when I had the TBI in the MVA.  It feels like there is a sharp metal rod thrusting through that hole in my skull, causing temporary insanity.  I know it's "all in my head", but that doesn't stop it from hurting like hell when it's happening.  I've briefly screamed aloud multiple times when it happens.  I can't imagine being in any sort of PT and screaming like that, it would scare everyone in the building.  I'm working through it, slowly recovering.  Able to bend the knee to 80° now, <a href="images/20200927T224045Z-knee_80_degrees.jpg">just measured</a>.  Still frequent vertigo, but haven't fallen in about a month now (at least).<br>
20201008T005756Z: It seems this has turned into a log of complaints.  If you're reading this, sorry for that.  At this point, I have no other place that I can record these types of things.  I'm just now recovering from 24 hours of intense stomach cramps.  Slept most of it off.  Finally had a painful bowel movement.  Now I'm finally able to sit down and type again, but I have had a twitching eyelid in my left eye for 3 days now.  It's making me feel very on edge, hating life and everything around me.  It's difficult to focus on the text on the screen, and my typing skills are complete gone.  It's as if my fingers have forgotten where the keys are to type.  FML<br>
20201008T010547Z: instead of just recording my complaints here, I'll add some good news; President Donald Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was hospitalized.  He has already been released from the hospital and has already returned to the oval office, all in less than a week from testing positive.  Smh...<br>
<div id="20201029T192823Z"></div>20201029T192823Z: Since the last update, I joined a TBI support group through <a href="https://www.loveyourbrain.com/">loveyourbrain.com</a>.  There have been two weekly meetings already, via <a href="https://zoom.us">zoom</a>.  I also got got kicked off <a href="https://cash.app">CashApp</a>.  I got <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKNoQ2w3UhXrOS42JIPGC1tKGii2YLIl/view?usp=sharing">this email</a> from them stating they closed my account for violating their Terms & Conditions, but gave absolutely no specifics of which terms or which conditions I supposedly violated.  I feel violated.  I loved CashApp.  I was even paying my rent to my landlord using CashApp.  I've tried emailing them several times, have tried using their Contact Us forms multiple times, and have tried contacting them via Twitter as well.  Every time they gave lame responses (like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kxb9LOqFsZtEXown_JS5eBC0u4SMh6UW/view?usp=sharing">this</a>).<br>
20201202T095557Z: Did not complete the <a href="https://www.loveyourbrain.com/mindset">loveyourbrain.com Minset Online</a> course successfully because two weeks ago I had another round of migraines that started a day before the scheduled meetup.  The migraines completely wiped me out for one whole week, causing me to completely miss my scheduled online meetup on November 18, 2020.  I was looking forward to resuming on November 25, 2020, but the migraines forced me back into staying awake all night and sleeping during the day.  I was asleep during the time of the Nov 25 meeting.  It turned out to be the last meeting of that set, so I guess I'm just not ready for that much structure of a schedule yet.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime in the spring.<br>
20201202T112324Z: Woke a few hours ago screaming with extreme pain in my gastrocnemius muscle in my left leg.  After reading up on it, I suspect it was because of dehydration.  The only thing I've done differently than normal in the last 24 hours was drink less water (because I'm down to my last 5 gallon jug, I tried to slow down my intake).  Time to see about finding a way to get more Deer Park water delivered.  I wonder if there are any delivery services except ReadyRefresh; after having them rip me off royally, I do not want to ever do business with them again.<br>
20201212T041032Z: Bought a new laptop since the last one I had was starting to show signs of old age.  Started migrating and within a few hours of starting, the ssd in the old laptop completely died to the point that it won't even boot anymore.  Thankfully I have a recent backup of the most vital file, a KeepassXC .kbdx file, that I store my various passwords and private keys in.  I'm sure I lost some stuff in the crash, things like scripts that I started trying to put together, but nothing that can't be replaced/rewritten.  My English teacher in high school always said, "The best form of writing is rewriting".  I suppose the same can be said for code as well.<br>
20201216T035852Z: I'm pleasantly surprised to find that my name was mentioned in <a href="https://archive.vn/0qZn8#selection-1919.1-1919.12">the v0.12.0-beta.rc1 release of lnd</a><br>
20210125T071502Z: I created a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/4EEB0DBEE81D6E5189724EE3042F9E7456930D02">keyoxide</a> account within the last 24 hours.<br>
20210128T002529Z: The original bitcoin whitepaper is forever embedded in the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.  If you run a full bitcoin node, use this command to access it:<br>

20210301T020903Z: Just now coming out of another round of debilitating migraines.  This round started two days ago.  Within the last 24 hours I was in agony with vertigo, headache pain, and migraine induced light-sensitivity that I literally cried myself to sleep like a baby, head buried under pillows.  Luckily I bought some Exedrin Migraine pills recently.  Never tried them before.  Took 2 within the last couple hours.  Migraine is about 75-80% gone.  At least heading in the right direction.<br>
20210301T073413Z: Randomly surfed upon <a href="https://livebitcoindata.com/dashboard/">https://livebitcoindata.com/dashboard/</a>, neat site!<br>
20210303T215215Z: Apparently I'm now also using this github repository to keep track of links to neat stuff; I want to remember <a href="https://github.com/jhoenicke/mempool">Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool</a><br>
20210317T211931Z: Migraines and vertigo again today to the point where I felt nauseous, had to lay down to try to sleep through it.  Ginger ale helped enormously.  Current price of bitcoin at block height 675073 is 57755 (on BitStamp)<br>
20210328T100344Z: Setting up an Umbrel Bitcoin + Lightning node.  It's finally fully synched now.  You can open a LN channel to me at 02895c411a00215a4b3e52d81fa16ac0578a2f4ab063ef4a6410e9bd7a90ab3bef@exaumgj223tfk4n4n5me3te35c2mahvqrppguvzpwy3vffbrcoducrqd.onion:9735<br>
20210412T192723Z: Migraines, mind fog, and vertigo nearly non-stop lately.  The only good health news I have is that I got my first (of two) COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer shots.  My USB hub died recently.  That cut off my external hard drive (used for archival purposes primarily).  Between the time that I ordered a new USB hub and got it replaced, I got locked out of my primary laptop because Ubuntu would only boot to a blank screen.  I'm back in now, after wrestling with it for 2+ days, but am now operating without any active weekly backups.  Need to try to replace that USB hub over the next few hours.<br>
20210424T011324Z: Successfully replaced USB hub.<br>
20210608T014342Z: Got my 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot on Thursday April 29, 2021.  Got to see my kids on May 16, 2021.<br>
20210619T172645Z: I ran into an old friend randomly online.  Small world.  Hi Tyler!<br>
20210724T045058Z: COVID-19 is spreading worldwide.  There is a great division amongst those who wear a mask and those who do not.  I have masks to wear and I would prefer to wear them if/when I go out in public, even though I am fully vaccinated.  Ever since the TBI in the MVA in 2016, I have nearly total anosmia (unable to smell anything).  Sometimes I get such violent and unexpected sneezes that come with little to no warning.  I believe those unexpected sneezes have something to do with my anosmia.  If there's something that smells weird, like pepper for instance, it might make any normal person sneeze... but there would at least be a sense of warning that you're about to sneeze.  With anosmia, that sense of warning is missing entirely, so the sneeze can come quickly and violently.  I want to wear a mask to protect others around me from those sudden unexpected sneezes.  Any normal person would be able to at least sneeze into their hands or arm.  In a world of COVID-19, I would not want to violently randomly sneeze into a stranger's face by accident.  If that were to happen to the wrong person, they could easily take it offensively and I am looking to avoid that altogether by simply wearing a mask to protect them.<br>
20210724T045203Z: Within the last 48 hours, I saw an ad online for Motus Nova (which is latin for New Motion).  I filled out a form for them to contact me.  I received a call from them a few hours ago.  I excitedly ordered a <a href="https://archive.ph/ewMV3">Motus Foot</a>, hoping it can help me regain control of my left leg.  They asked me to rate, on a scale of 0-10, how recovered I feel from the MVA (which was just over 5 years ago now).  I rated my recovery a 2/10 currently since I still have a very hard time standing, walking, or sitting down (especially on the toilet).  I'm hoping this AI-powered device will help reduce my vertigo by strengthening my left ankle, and reduce the terrifyingly loud cracking noises my ankle makes when stretching.  The cracking noises it makes currently seem abnormally loud.  Nearly everytime I hear them, it causes me to have flashbacks of the MVA since the cracking noises my ankle makes sound just like what cracking bones in the crash sounds like.  They said there is a one month waiting list for the device.  I am now on that waiting list.<br>
20210729T044007Z: I installed an app called Syncthing on my phone and saw how useful it could be.  I wanted to make a donation to them, but they did not accept bitcoin as a payment option.  I asked that they add an option to accept donations via bitcoin in their forum here: <a href="https://forum.syncthing.net/t/donate-via-bitcoin/16998/1">https://forum.syncthing.net/t/donate-via-bitcoin/16998/1</a> | <a href="https://archive.ph/UPvUE">https://archive.ph/UPvUE</a>.<br>
20210807T195819Z: The <a href="https://archive.ph/ewMV3">Motus Foot</a> arrived yesterday in two giant boxes.  I was able to open one of the two yesterday.  It looked like it was for the right foot.  I need physical therapy for my left foot, so this thing might need to go back.  I slept overnight.  Got the second box opened just now.  There was a bunch of paperwork in it.  I started snapping pictures of each page so that I wouldn't lose track of it all.  Vertigo set in about halfway through.  My back is wicked sore from standing that long.  I had to quit halfway through taking pictures of the paperwork and come sit down in front of my laptop and fan (on high, since I'm sweating pretty good just from standing for the 10-15 minutes).  I saw on the <a href="https://archive.ph/ewMV3">Motus Foot</a> website that they have a 10-day money back guarantee.  Since the time is ticking, I'll need to try to continue unboxing this thing later this evening once I'm able.<br>
20210904T153546Z: Had another round of totally brutal migranes within the last week.  So severe that I was literally crying in pain until the spinning from the extreme verigo made me vomit.  Now that the migraines are gone, my short term memory is once again completely fucked.  Example; I decided to take a shower when I woke up this morning.  I couldn't remember if I had used shampoo or not as I was standing there in the shower.  I think this probably happened a couple times, so I ended up re-lathering my hair with more shampoo.  Got out and toweled off, only to find the towel full of shampoo suds.  So apparently I did use shampoo, but then forgot to rinse it out of my hair.  Had to get back into the shower to rinse it out.  Getting in and out of the shower even once is very painful with an unbendable knee, that's why I shower very infrequently.  Rinsed, then realized I forgot to get a clean towel before getting back in.  So got out naked, dripping wet, dried off, and am now adding this note to this journal.  Losing your ability to remember pretty much anything really sucks.  I would pray that you never get a TBI, even if you were my worst enemy.<br>
20210904T155630Z: I realized that my previous update was very negative, so figured I should throw in a positive update to lighten this journal up a bit.  While I am very angry at the situation I'm in, I am still very thankful to be alive.  I am thankful for the doctors that helped me this far, and still hateful toward the doctor(s) that misdiagnosed me at OrthoNY.  I am thankful that I was able to make it to a deep cleaning dental appointment recently, and pay the $695.00 cost with my Social Security income.  I am thankful that I have a roof over my head, food to eat, electricity to power things where I live, a laptop to type this from, arms and fingers to type with, and enough brain power left to put together any journal entries at all.  I am thankful that I have 3 healthy children.  I'm sorry I am unable to support them financially, but thankful that Social Security is there to help with that.<br>
20211002T090823Z: Still alive.  Still struggling with frequent migraines, despite the prescription medicine, Emgality, I'm taking for them.  My neurologist said he is going to switch my prescription to something different.  Hope that helps.<br>
20211119T092422Z: Saw my neurologist on October 26, 2021.  The migration medication, Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) 75mg, that I tried a sample since the previous time I saw him (and that I found worked beautifully), he wrote a prescription for it for me, but Medicare said it was not allowed.  He gave me a few more samples of Nurtec and said save them for when the migraines are severe.  So now I'm still on the Emgality monthly injections and am paying a very high price for a medication that works 3 for about 3 of 4 weeks each month.<br>
<span id="20211119T093441Z"></span>20211119T093441Z: I returned the Motus Foot device back to Motus Nova.  The cost was too high since it was costing $699/month out-of-pocket for it since I couldn't get a doctor who would prescribe it.  Good news is that it really helped a lot; I have regained control of my left foot a lot more now since using it, and I fall over a lot less often now.  Still having major problems with my left knee, and overall weakness on the entire left side of my body.  Switched my Primary Care physician to a new one (since the last doctor that I've had for the last 20 years does not accept Medicare insurance).  On the appointment request form it said, "Most important thing you want addressed during this visit?".  I responded with: "Annual physical.  I am Disabled following MVA in 2016.  Discuss options for physical therapy to address vertigo, instability due to loss of strength in left leg + unbendable left knee due to Heterotopic Ossification following TBI + broken bones.".  That appointment is scheduled for first available; Thursday December 16, 2021, 2:00 PM EST.<br>
<span id="20211123T155506Z"></span>20211123T155506Z: Just cooked a chicken patty in the air fryer.  Put it in a bun.  Took a big bite, swallowed.  Went to take the next bite.  That's when I noticed the mold on the bun.  Unsure where else to record this info, I'm putting it here, just in case I end up sick (or worse?).  With the anosmia from the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">2016-07-22 MVA</a> it's difficult/impossible for me to detect spoiled food.  This time, I swallowed some before realizing it was moldy.  Ew.<br>
20220109T225416Z: Still alive.  I have no recollection of that mold incident as noted in the <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com/#20211123T155506Z">20211123T155506Z</a> update.  I guess it didn't kill me.  Had another round of debilitating migraines.  Used one of the Nurtec ODT in the beginning stages of it.  It knocked it out within 10 minutes.  I was able to be productive since taking the Nurtec tablet; replaced my primary laptop (named "mab") with a new Dell laptop (named "margaret").  I had problems with backing up the old laptop before having to retire it.  Mab's primary problem was it's display.  Ended up turning mab into a headless server.  Received mail from Medicare saying coverage for Nurtec was not approved.  My neurologist's office appealed their denial and the appeal was denied as well.  I'm thinking that these timestamped entries about the migraines might somehow help in the fight to get the meds that I know work.<br>
20220109T230846Z: regarding the note in <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com/#20211119T093441Z">20211119T093441Z</a> my doctor appointment on December 16, 2021, 2:00 PM EST; I made it to that appointment.  I remember having gone.  I remember the doctor saying she would put in a referral for orthopedics for the pain and loss of motion on my left knee.  I have not yet followed up on that.  I'll do that soon.<br>
20220117T062448Z: Progress on my bad left knee was made tonight.  As I was doing the exercises that my PT instructor gave to me when I last saw them a few years ago, I heard a LOUD crack.  Imagine the sound a large storage trunk would make when the top swung shut suddenly; that kind of sound.  Obviously something big shifted in a way it has never before.  I measured the flexion with my protractor.  I can now bend the knee 91°.  That's a 22.147651006711% increase of 74.5° which was my flexion number for the last few years.  The muscle spasms came on quickly afterwards, and now the dull pain is kicking in.  It'll likely be a rough night.  Taking an Advil for the pain now.  That's something I rarely do.  Advil works when used sparingly, especially for times like these.  Also got a 3-month supply of Emgality refilled recently, and injected last night, so hopefully no more migraines for a while now.<br>
20220209T114030Z: Time is flying.  Very painful left knee, but still exercising and pushing as hard as I possibly can.  Flexion is now up to 112°.  Progress made in terms of what I'm able to do with that flexion: for the first time in 5+ years since the accident, I was able to sit on the toilet without having to first remove my pants in order to do.  Sounds ridiculous, but I dare you to try to sit on a toilet without bending your knee.  It's impossible.  So what I've been doing for 5+ years every time I've had to sit down on a toilet is to first remove my pants, then slowly balance my body down with my good leg bending, and my bad leg/knee nearly straight out in front of me.  Makes for a very unpleasent and painful experience.  Afterwards I would usually need to lay down in bed because the positioning on the toilet would usually pinch a nerve (or cut off blood flow?) to my left leg, causing the leg to "fall asleep".  That sensation you get in a limb when you get that feels like "pins-and-needles" is called <i>paresthesia</i> and I've been experiening it daily every time I need to sit on toilet for years now, everyday since the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">2016-07-22 MVA</a>.  The longer that I sit straddled on the toilet with one leg normally bent, and the other abnormally straight out (because of the unbendable knee), the worse the pins-and-needles are when I stand again.  The pain is sometimes so severe that I cannot put any weight on my left leg at all.  A simple touch of the toe to the floor is excruciating pain.  It feels like being electrocuted.  Daily is pure torture.  But over the years, I've grown used to it.  This is one of those things that I forget to tell my doctors about.  By laying down in bed, the pins-and-needles stop within 30-60 minutes, so I've come to accept this as normal.  Now that my left knee is bending further than it has for years, I'll try to keep track of whether the paresthesia is now less than it has been for years now.<br>
20220228T112300Z: My health has taken a turn for the worse since my last update.  As I write this, I am in pain.  My lower back has locked up on me to the point that I cannot sit down, or even bend over the slightest amount, without shocking pain that makes me yelp in agony.  I've had this happen a few times in the past, but it's usually caused by some extreme stress or rigourous physical activity.  This time around, I'm not sure what caused it.  Sure the world is as close to World War III as it's ever been, now that Russia has invaded Ukraine within the last week, but aside from that, it's been the usual complaints here.  Now it causes me great pain to even sit in my computer chair and type this.  I had one prescription muscke relaxer left over from the last time this happened.  I took half of it.  It seemed to help, but I ended up sleeping in bed for what seemed like forever.  Ugh.  Right now, life really sucks.<br>
20220323T115215Z: The good news is that my lower back problem has gotten better; I'm able to sit in a chair again now, and am able to hobble around with a cane.  Yesterday I made it to a dentist appointment and finished the installaion of an implant of a molar.  I also mentioned that I had a recurrent abscess flare up recently that I elminated by using a round of antibiotics.  The dentst said he wanted some x-rays of the affected area of the abscess and sent in an assistent to take those pictures.  She must have been brand new as she did not know how to properly log into the computer, record the x-rays taken, or even properly find my tooth number #31 that he mentioned (she asked me if that was on the left or right).  She ended up taking about 12 x-rays, instead of just the 2 that I needed.  Thanks for the extra radiation.  After getting back home, I ended up falling asleep in bed very early, only to be awakened in screaming pain with a charlie horse in my left leg calf.  Drank water, fell back asleep.  Today the calf is very painful still to hobble on.<br>
20220615T055652Z: The most recent round of migraines knocked me out for 24 hours in bed since the vertigo was so severe that it made me nauseous to be awake during the daylight hours.  Since last update, I started a private guthub repository whiich will be used to track progress on my glenbot2 project.  Maybe someday I'll share that code.<br>
20220704T180903Z: Today is July 4th.  Everyone is celebrating.  I am not going out.  I don't want to go out.  I want to continue doing anything positive that I possibly can for myself and my life.  I have no interest in hanging out with anyone who is intoxicated, or who has had even a single drink.  I am sober now, and I love that sobriety.  Hopefully I can/will remain sober for the rest of my life.<br>
20220724T012505Z: I love <a href="https://stacker.news">https://stacker.news</a>.  You can find me on there as <a href="https://stacker.news/1GLENCoop">https://stacker.news/1GLENCoop</a><br>
20220828T141112Z: Upgraded my laptop from Ubuntu 20.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 recently.  Several things stopped working following the upgrade;<br>

20221115T190807Z: Since last update quite a lot has happened.  My memory seems to be getting worse rather than better.  I suppose this could be said to be because of old age, but I'm only 48, but with a severe TBI in my medical history, I suppose that makes me more like 88 instead.  I forgot my son's birthday again back in September.  Last year, I missed it by a couple days.  This year I missed it by a little over a month.  That sent me into a deep depression.  The time since my last update has been very difficult.  The depression has led to me not being able to get out of bed longer than to take my daily meds.  On one day, I was able to get out of bed, but the depression was so bad that all I was able to do was get out of bed, eat a bowl of cereal, and then go back to sleep before I took that day's medications, only to rise the next day and realize I never took yesterday's meds.<br>
20221115T191607Z: The latest drama in the bitcoin world news is the bankruptcy of one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX.  Fortunately I was unaffected since I never used that exchaneg.  What so many people fail to realize, at least the majority of individuals I speak with IRL, is that the implosion of FTX has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin is now stronger than it's ever been before since the hashrate of the miners protecting it is at near all-time highs; currently 241.347 Ehash/s.  As long as you are self-custodying your bitcoin in your own wallet where you control the private keys, you have nothing to worry about.<br>
20221228T152617Z: It's been a rough winter here with extreme cold temperatures.  Only saw a brief snow shower here thus far, but much of the country was hit with Blizard conditions for days resulting in 50+ deaths.  Glad to not try travelling this Christmas; the airports are clogged due to the nationwide weather challenges.<br>
20230110T170752Z: Just got back home from an appointment at Quest Diagnostics for some blood tests that my new neurologist ordered.  I was very happy that the woman drawing the blood asked repeatedly that my name was printed correctly on the sticker already stuck on each vial.  I told her about how I was misdiagnosed by OrthoNY and that experience pretty much ruined my trust of any doctors or anyone in the medical field, and thanked her for being thorough with proper verification with each step in the process.<br>
