20190403T0502Z: In every moment I start typing a journal entry, or add a pointcode within any code I write, I use the timestamp that occurred the very second I looked at my clock on my laptop.  I only go by Zulu time.  See <a href="https://timestamps.glencooper.com">timestamps.glencooper.com</a> for details.<br>
20190403T0617Z: I've been keeping a journal (in a MediaWiki) at <a href="https://recovery.glencooper.com/">https://recovery.glencooper.com</a> for a long time now.  It's just one problem after another with trying to maintain doing that in a provable way.  I've therefore made the decision to build a subdomain of "trust.glencooper.com" which will be set up with a CNAME DNS record pointing at GlenCooper.github.io.  I've already sent the DNS update to my hosting provider, and am currently awaiting the DNS change to propogate.<br>
20190403T0731Z: yay! looks like the DNS change has propogated: <a href="20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt">20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt</a><br>
20190403T0753Z: my vertigo is now at a 9 out of 10 scale.  I'm going to try to catch some sleep and hope that tomorrow's migraines won't be as unbearable as they've been the last few days.  I'll try to figure out what's going on with the subdomain trust.glencooper.com when I continue this after some sleep.<br>
