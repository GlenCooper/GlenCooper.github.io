20190403T0502Z: In every moment I start typing a journal entry, or add a pointcode within any code I write, I use the timestamp that occurred the very second I looked at my clock on my laptop.  I only go by Zulu time.  See <a href="https://timestamps.glencooper.com">timestamps.glencooper.com</a> for details.<br>
20190403T0617Z: I've been keeping a journal (in a MediaWiki) at <a href="https://recovery.glencooper.com/">https://recovery.glencooper.com</a> for a long time now.  It's just one problem after another with trying to maintain doing that in a provable way.  I've therefore made the decision to build a subdomain of "trust.glencooper.com" which will be set up with a CNAME DNS record pointing at GlenCooper.github.io.  I've already sent the DNS update to my hosting provider, and am currently awaiting the DNS change to propogate.<br>
20190403T0731Z: yay! looks like the DNS change has propogated: <a href="20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt">20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt</a><br>
20190403T0753Z: my vertigo is now at a 9 out of 10 scale.  I'm going to try to catch some sleep and hope that tomorrow's migraines won't be as unbearable as they've been the last few days.  I'll try to figure out what's going on with the subdomain trust.glencooper.com when I continue this after some sleep.<br>
20190403T0950Z: tried to get some sleep.  Tossed and turned for about an hour.  Was finally drifting off, almost into a deep sleep phase (thanks <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-smart-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8">Sleep Cycle app</a> for the analysis) when I was rudely awoken by a sudden whack of a pillow (or blanket?) by the person who was asleep in the bed next to me, whose name I am purposely omitting at this time, to protect the innocent.  It was an honest mistake.  That's not the point.  The point is; I'm back at the keys, forging onward.<br>
20190403T1039Z: installed <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> for the first time ever.  This line right here is the first time I've ever used the software, and I'm already wildly in love with it.  Goodbye vim and the wacky/problematic colorschemes that go along with it.  Hello <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1048Z: added git and github to atom.  Let's see if commits and pushes are any easier now...?<br>
20190403T1054Z: I need to go lay down for a few minutes.  Atom, you just blew my mind away.  How on earth could I not have found you until now?!  Where have you been all my life?  Thinking of all the time I've wasted wrestling with vim and code without you.  Ugh.  Wow.  Nice!!!  Suberb job, developers of <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1343Z: Got a short bit of sleep in.  Woke with a start, anxious to continue building on this page.  Successfully got the subdomain <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> working, but the https part is not functional yet.  The related Github message says: "Not yet available for your site because the certificate has not finished being issued.  Please allow 24 hours for this process to complete. (trust.glencooper.com)"<br>
20190403T1354Z: worth noting that my vertigo is noticably less after a nap.  I'm now off to battle trying to track down and log into each of my bank accounts to figure out the exact balances on each in order to reapply for food stamps (again!).  FML.<br>
20190403T1358Z: just after committing and pushing that last entry, I reloaded <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> and noticed that it immediately/automatically updated to <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com">https://trust.glencooper.com</a>.  Sweet!<br>
