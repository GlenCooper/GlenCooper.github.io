20190403T0502Z: In every moment I start typing a journal entry, or add a pointcode within any code I write, I use the timestamp that occurred the very second I looked at my clock on my laptop.  I only go by Zulu time.  See <a href="https://timestamps.glencooper.com">timestamps.glencooper.com</a> for details.<br>
20190403T0617Z: I've been keeping a journal (in a MediaWiki) at <a href="https://recovery.glencooper.com/">https://recovery.glencooper.com</a> for a long time now.  It's just one problem after another with trying to maintain doing that in a provable way.  I've therefore made the decision to build a subdomain of "trust.glencooper.com" which will be set up with a CNAME DNS record pointing at GlenCooper.github.io.  I've already sent the DNS update to my hosting provider, and am currently awaiting the DNS change to propogate.<br>
20190403T0731Z: yay! looks like the DNS change has propogated: <a href="20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt">20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt</a><br>
20190403T0753Z: my vertigo is now at a 9 out of 10 scale.  I'm going to try to catch some sleep and hope that tomorrow's migraines won't be as unbearable as they've been the last few days.  I'll try to figure out what's going on with the subdomain trust.glencooper.com when I continue this after some sleep.<br>
20190403T0950Z: tried to get some sleep.  Tossed and turned for about an hour.  Was finally drifting off, almost into a deep sleep phase (thanks <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-smart-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8">Sleep Cycle app</a> for the analysis) when I was rudely awoken by a sudden whack of a pillow (or blanket?) by the person who was asleep in the bed next to me, whose name I am purposely omitting at this time, to protect the innocent.  It was an honest mistake.  That's not the point.  The point is; I'm back at the keys, forging onward.<br>
20190403T1039Z: installed <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> for the first time ever.  This line right here is the first time I've ever used the software, and I'm already wildly in love with it.  Goodbye vim and the wacky/problematic colorschemes that go along with it.  Hello <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1048Z: added git and github to atom.  Let's see if commits and pushes are any easier now...?<br>
20190403T1054Z: I need to go lay down for a few minutes.  Atom, you just blew my mind away.  How on earth could I not have found you until now?!  Where have you been all my life?  Thinking of all the time I've wasted wrestling with vim and code without you.  Ugh.  Wow.  Nice!!!  Suberb job, developers of <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1343Z: Got a short bit of sleep in.  Woke with a start, anxious to continue building on this page.  Successfully got the subdomain <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> working, but the https part is not functional yet.  The related Github message says: "Not yet available for your site because the certificate has not finished being issued.  Please allow 24 hours for this process to complete. (trust.glencooper.com)"<br>
20190403T1354Z: worth noting that my vertigo is noticably less after a nap.  I'm now off to battle trying to track down and log into each of my bank accounts to figure out the exact balances on each in order to reapply for food stamps (again!).  FML.<br>
20190403T1358Z: just after committing and pushing that last entry, I reloaded <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> and noticed that it immediately/automatically updated to <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com">https://trust.glencooper.com</a>.  Sweet!<br>
20190403T1416Z: this is what got me going last night on setting up a public journal: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HBsL3hsT9wEo3LvDJy8BO6LVxXQHYob">20190402T2339Z-key_bank_password_reset_FAIL.png</a>.  A little background here: I missed another deadline on the most recent food stamps paperwork.  They wanted Unearned Income Payment Verification.  I tried to log into my first of several bank accounts to get a recent statement, and right off the bat I couldn't remember my first bank's password.  When I tried to do a password reset, I got the SMS text message successfully, but when I put it into their password reset thing on their website, it gave the error message of "We are unable to assist you with unlocking your user ID.  You will need to contact us at 1-800-539-1539".  That's when I decided that I've had enough of wrestling with the banks, trying to prove that I have no money left.... and they won't even let me do that.  Sigh.  I'm about to call that # now.  I will record the call, as I do ALL calls, since I can't remember what is said by the end of the call, or they'll say I remembered what was said incorrectly.  I need proof of every phonecall, and my solution to that is to record every call... for quality and training purposes only, of course.<br>
20190403T1432Z: I despise using phones.  I tried once more to do a password reset.  It worked.  I'm now logged into my <a href="https://www.key.com/">KeyBank</a> bank account.<br>
20190403T1524Z: saw that I recently paid $6.00 for a printed bank statement from my primary checking account at KeyBank.  I did that to test out whether or not USPS was delivering any of my mail here.  Found out USPS was returning all of my mail as "Undeliverable".  Got that sorted with USPS.  Now I need to go back to all of my banks and lawyers to have them resend the stuff that was errorneously returned as Undeliverable.  I called KeyBank and got them to send another printed statement, no charge this time around. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s_-6FPU59ccyxlI2NPIhc77FPX7Ltq2Y">call recorded</a>)<br>
20190403T2326Z: the vertigo won me over today.  It was so bad that I had to lay down.  When I did, I fell asleep.  Woke up hours later, feeling much better.  Checked on my SSDI application status.  It says "Status = Processing".  Continuing on trying to get my bank paperwork together to reapply for food stamps.<br>
20190404T2047Z: Migraines killed my productivity for today.  I stopped taking Advil because I've been dealing with an internal bleeding problem for the last month or so.  I'd rather bury my head in the pillows all day rather than deal with the... well... I will stop going on and on about the gruesome details of my many health issues in this public place.  Let's just say, I am alive, but am currently struggling with ongoing health issues.  I'm pondering ways to break up public vs. private.  I've heard that github has private repositories.  Maybe now would be a good time for me to look into that.<br>
20190405: responded to a cybercoders recruiter via email.  I'll find that and see if I can edit it and upload it here eventually.<br>
20190906T1414Z: TBI-related migraines ongoing, but functional enough to at least update this wiki to say I'm still alive.  Warring with Social Security about them not being able to update an address of mine that appears on their Benefit Verification letter.  It's an address I moved out of over 20 years ago.  I've called them multiple times and even went into a local office in person already requesting they update it.  Each time it's always a different excuse they give why it's still not updated on their website yet.<br>
20190408T013238Z: I added a new button to my bookmarks toolbar in my firefox browser that that I can now just do one click, cut-and-paste, and then instantly have the current iso-8601 timestamp instantly created, and cut-and-pastable to whatever I want. Eventually I hope to make it so that a simple one-click will copy the value to the mouse buffer. The bookmark is linked to <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">timestamp.glencooper.com</a><br>
20190409T055336Z: spent the entire day organizing paperwork for my disability lawyers, and scheduling a doctor appointment with a specialist for an ongoing health issue I've been dealing with over the last month.  Winding down... calling it quits for tonight.  No progress made on anything glencooper.com related... only making this update because I'm super tired now and this is the kind of nonsense I do when I'm deleriously tired.<br>
20190409T171313Z: received a frustrating message from my primary doctor's office that they're unable to open the link that I spent a ton of time on putting together for them yesterday.  I put all of my medical data that I had from when I was in the hospital for 2 months onto 5 DVD ISOs, and made that info available in a single-click Google Drive link... and they say they can't open it.  So apparently they must not have internet access there... yet they're able to correspond to me via their internet-connected website portal... hmm.. re-thinking how to handle this latest drama.<br>
20190409T224144Z: figured out how to get my care summaries from the two hospitals I was in (in Charlottesville).  Got those uploaded to my current primary doctor's portal.<br>
20190410T145302Z: There's no indication that my care summaries were accepted or entered into my online portal with my doctor.  I guess I'll have to make hardcopies and bring them into the doctor's office.<br>
20190410T223820Z: made it to my doctor's office (via Uber).  Asked him to please fill out my SNAPET application for food stamps.  He did.<br>
20190411T060827Z: I'm kinda liking the <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">https://timestamp.glencooper.com</a> bookmark.  I should see how hard it'd be to add a 1-click copy-to-buffer action would be...<br>
20190411T184903Z: wasted too much time trying to get it working to where I could simply one-click something on the page to get it to copy to buffer.<br>
20190412T235119Z: I think my next endeavor will be to build something where I can have a one-answer response to the most common question everyone asks me; "What have you been doing?", or "What do you do all day?".  The problem I have with that is, I don't recall.  I try to only think going forward, not looking back.  If someone wants to know what I've been doing, please don't waste my time asking me questions like that.  Ever since TBI, have a very difficult time remembering things, or some idiot liars will say I don't remember them correctly.  That's why I've chosen github to provably show my history and thought processes.  If you don't understand the things that you read about that I'm spending my time on, that's not my fault that you don't understand.  Learn about things like bitcoin.  Learn about things like <a href="https://lnd.glencooper.com">lnd.glencooper.com</a>.  Learn about things like coding.  Learn to code.  I believe The Lightning Network is going to guarantee that bitcoin (BTC) will always be the #1 cryptocurrency in the world.  I would be a multi-millionaire if I held onto any of the thousands of them I've had over the years instead of buying useless crap with them.<br>
20190413T231816Z: Continuing to struggle with health problems.  Not a whole lot to report on this front, except I have spent a fair amount of time on <a href="https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library">https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library</a> today.  Ran into a problem and need to rethink how this would be possible to maintain security in an open-source fashion.<br>
20190417T035051Z: Hell is real.  I know this because I am living in it right now as I write this.  I've been in it for over two years now.  It will be 3 years exactly on July 22, 2019, see <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">mva.glencooper.com</a>.  I'll never give up trying to code again.  I have yet to succeed.<br>
20190421T062719Z: just adding an update to say that I built (yet another) subdomain: <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>.  The idea behind it is that I have created bitcoin firstbits for several trusted friends and family members, and intend to give them the private keys to those addresses someday.  Of course private keys are meant to be always kept private, so by me having created those BTC firstbits addresses for them, therein lies the trust.  LOL... I just re-read that as I was typing it and chuckled at the absurdity of it all.  Bitcoin has taught me....... [15 minutes elapsed].  I'm tired.  I'm ending this here.<br>
20190421T152817Z: starting to listen to <a href="https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024">https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024</a> right now.  Having just lost half of another of my few remaining molars (while eating a hotdog), I need to shift my mental focus away from my health and dental woes, and see if I can do anything productive.<br>
20190423T024732Z: Sometime recently I threw together a logo for <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>, and captured a snapshot of it in the internet archive at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/</a>.  Within the last 24 hours, I finally received some USPS mail at my current address.  Planning on using that mail as my proof of address until I can get a replacement DMV ID card.  Ordered one with my current address on it months ago, but the USPS returned the mailed ID card to DMV as Undeliverable.  I should follow up with DMV about the updated ID card.<br>
20190518T061905Z: Still struggling here.  Still alive.  Miserable.  I don't tolerate the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HYc3uXpz7Zmsvhw6qveq_9nAIdwx28_l">81% humidity</a> well at all.<br>
20190518T210539Z: I had another problem with USPS again recently.  One of my favorite banks, <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com/">Aspiration</a>, sent me <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16Y1QsanOdD8r5t2NA26f0lIvkcmxMhFr">an email</a> saying that a new debit card that they tried to send me was returned to them.  Before getting that email, I tried to do an EFT transfer from my primary checking to <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a>.  That EFT transfer attempt was returned.  So now I need to waste more precious time dealing with banking woes.<br>
20190519T001104Z: I hate banks.  I just wasted the last 2 hours dealing with the <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a> returned card problem.  (Only members of GlenCooper.com should have security access permissions to allow reading of this data): <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c88ViBm0_uBzE_h2Vl64wSMLnF06txJW">20190518T2359Z-ryan_at_aspiration_sucks.pdf</a>).<br>
20190523T192810Z: The problem with <a href="https://aspiration.glencooper.com">Aspiration</a> is believed to be resolved now: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i9TVKImDGUBM-EZcBuxjDmXrfKCa5u1Y">20190521T0032Z-aspiration_ryan_sobered_up.pdf</a><br>
20190602T070805Z: Adding an update here just to say I'm still alive.  That's all there is for good news right now.  I'll skip all of the bad news.<br>
20190716T040531Z: I was deemed Disabled by Social Security definitions as a results of the 2016-07-11 MVA that I was in (see <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com/">mva.glencooper.com</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902022348/https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Rescuers-dispatched-to-serious-crash-on-I-81-387992682.html">mirror1</a>).<br>
20190723T070514Z: the heat index here in Reston, VA has been over 100℉ for a couple days now.<br>
20190725T090037Z: finally the heat wave has broken (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LcMYqtlrPApr7xaYvugbCXysqOqkluEM">20190725T0904Z-weather.png</a>).<br>
20190824T104043Z: My neurologist prescribed Emgality for the frequent migraines that I've been dealing with for a while now.  Omg.  Emgality works.  I've had noticably less severe migraines with a monthly Emgality shot.  I thought to make a short video this time around, and figured out how to work iMovie for the first time ever as well: (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12sq4oMnFuizX8Wg58XuCRt2Bp-owEISh">20190817T1638Z-emgality.mov</a>)<br>
20190831T024417Z: I'm in search of an open-source way to help organize this mess of a journal.  Something at least to make it so someone can quickly check the history by year/month in a calendar-like fashion.  Current price of bitcoin is $9644.12 USD for 1 BTC. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SQ3PEHxR1vMCVb9gWT4e8nJ9eDCAICjF">screenshot</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190831040934/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQ3PEHxR1vMCVb9gWT4e8nJ9eDCAICjF/view">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190902T022613Z: Saw some good friends of mine yesterday: (<a href="https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG">20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902025205/https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T164824Z0-GGK.JPG">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190904T082449Z: another recent pic: (<a href="https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG">20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190904083134/https://foundation.glencooper.com/semiprivate/20190831T154516Z-GGK.JPG">mirror1</a>)<br>
20190906T061958Z: anyone reading this should know that I am literally "slow" now ever since the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">2016-07-22 MVA</a>.  Me typing at all is a difficult task now.  It takes me 1000x average speed to type out a sentence.  I'm still hoping I can code again someday, but there's no way I could handle it yet.  My lack of focus makes it impossible.  At this point, I'm just hoping I can get some sleep.<br>
20190908T050546Z: As I was just randomly surfing, I somehow ended up on <a href="http://www.prettysimpleimages.com/#51">this page</a>, noticed a typo, and immediately stopped surfing, took (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lDRVJ_AAhdobZoqy_l9rqqpofytz9X8B">this screenshot</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190908051941/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDRVJ_AAhdobZoqy_l9rqqpofytz9X8B/view?usp=drive_open">mirror1</a>) with the typo circled in red.  I sent him an email about it from my glen@glencooper.com email.  And yes, I put my real email in this publicly viewable document.  I use gmail for my email, so I trust their spam filters.  Go ahead, spam me.  I dare you.  (In the back of my mind, I'm envisioning "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvEik9N_xWI">I dare ya motherfucker.  I double dare ya</a>").<br>
20190910T074049Z: One of my sons had some anger issues associated with Fortnite, a popular multiplayer game made by EpicGames.com.  I scanned thru their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/tos">T&C</a> and noticed that the page doesn't archive properly at <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a>.  It did get archived properly via <a href="https://archive.today">archive.today</a>: <a href="http://archive.fo/1jvpm">http://archive.fo/1jvpm</a>.  Figured I'd make note of that here for whatever reason.<br>
20190921T234751Z: I heard someone say something about github being purchased by Microsoft.  Somehow I also just happened upon <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-buy-github/">this article in Forbes</a> about it as well.<br>
20190921T235558Z: just for the record, I really dislike Microsoft primarily because I know that they stand no chance in comparison to the open source revolution.  I'd rather not have any of my code in a centralized repository.  I'm therefore now interested in investigating GitLab.<br>
20190922T001508Z: I'm am currently reading <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html">https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html</a>.  For the record, I believe we've reached a Singularity and that is BITCOIN.  The original bitcoin.  BTC.  Every single bitcoin transaction is PERMANENT, and <u>will be FOREVER</u>.  I've long thought that BTC is forever, hence the "[BTC is forever]" in my <a href="https://twitter.com/Crystamped">@Crystamped Twitter account</a>'s username.  I first realized that we've already reached a Singularity was earlier today shortly after I'd watched <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Kzmmclbx8">this Tone Vays YouTube video</a> when it was Live.  I believe bitcoin (BTC) was sent to us by superior intelligence beings not from this earth.  Yes, ET- ExtraTerristrials.  BTC and the LightningNetwork as a second layer scaling solution will decimate the banks and governments that have keps all of us living slaves for all of our life before bitcoin.<br>
20190622T010729Z: currently watching <a href="https://youtu.be/s8DCpG1PeaU">this video on YouTube</a> about the differences between GitHub and GitLab.<br>
20190922T035119Z: reading about <a href="https://medium.com/ci-cd-the-easy-way/how-to-use-git-branches-buddy-to-organize-project-code-sitepoint-e4c36c2d4217">Buddy CI/CD</a><br>
20190929T205117Z: As if junk mail wasn't bad enough, I've been getting a bunch of misdirected email from many different people.  All of the strange emails involve legal issues, so I suspect there's a lawyer Glenn Cooper somewhere and that's who they've meant to email(?).  In trying to do the right thing, I responded to the most recent misdirected email: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1varb8WgljctqZiBOT_2DkyrS8GOrSkHa">20190929T2053Z-misdirected_email.pdf</a><br>
20191003T040643Z: need to reboot.  Adding a note to self here: REMEMBER TO READ & FOLLOW UP ON THE MEDICARE MAIL THAT CAME YESTERDAY<br>
20191011T095353Z: Another wave of migraines and knee problems.  When able to function, my time and attention since the last update has been been completely consumed by <a href="https://bottle.glencooper.com">https://bottle.glencooper,com</a>.<br>
20191013T174146Z: After seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/NighttimeBTC/status/1183434454653657089?s=20">this Tweet</a>, figured I should at least update this.<br>
20191014T231555Z: SSH to my hosting account glencooper.com suddenly stopped working.  It was working constantly since I set it up over a year ago.  I'm positive I didn't do anything which could have suddenly caused it to stop working since I have passwordless logins set up (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Uc9EZtIlvLsZithyqGkgAHksKxunJvHO">screenshot</a>). I'll need to get ahold of hostgator.com's support.<br>
20191014T233016Z: the SSH started working again (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iwbiNAtmRM0syQsSBfrueFmuZvSOE2ni">screenshot</a>).  I haven't touched anything so it must have been something on their end.<br>
20191014T233356Z: SSH is failing again, (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KsYVOCB7peV0YO6cD06Km7cohqH8umal">screenshot</a>).  It's gotta be something on their end.<br>
20191015T074945Z: looks like hostgator finally fixed whatever was wrong.  SSH is working again. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KsYVOCB7peV0YO6cD06Km7cohqH8umal">screenshot</a>)<br>
20191017T034914Z: updating just to update for the hell of it.  Today was a very bad day for me.  One of those crazy days where nothing seemed to go right.  After a couple near psychotic episodes, I finally took a half a klonopin, or chill-pill as I like to call them.  It's working.  I'm calmed down now finally.  Yawning.  Sleep coming soon.<br>
20191022T041233Z: migraines and vertigo out the wazoo since my last update.  Having problems with just about everything online, including archive.org, archive.today, and a bunch of other crap.  Twitter is still going strong... and I happened to see a post on a Mastodon that I tried to archive, couldn't, so am posting it here: <a href="https://bitcoinhackers.org/@bitcoinedu/103003745609063624">https://bitcoinhackers.org/@bitcoinedu/103003745609063624</a>.<br>
20191022T041825Z: hmmm... if I'm in HTML already here... I wonder if I can just do this?:<br>

20191024T083832Z: my migraines have been brutal lately.  It's probably because I started an Emgality trial a while back, but then recently when I went to CVS for a refill, they said the monthly shot is no longer covered under my insurance plan, so they couldn't fill it unless I paid cash for it.  I didn't even ask how much it would cost.  In hindsight, I probably should have.  It doesn't really matter- I don't have any more money left so no matter how much it costs, I wouldn't be able to afford it.  My Medicare should have started by now, but I only received a basic pamplet in the mail about it, no card yet.  I called them two days ago, but slept since, and thanks to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/">TBI</a> in the 2016-07-22 MVA, my memory is completely erased roughly 75% of the nights I sleep, or at other random times.  Today I figured out that I spoke with them a few days ago, but already have no idea what was said on the call whatsoever.  Fortunately, I recorded the call, as I do with all government personnel interactions now.  When I started reviewing the recorded call, I realized that it contains my Social Security number, and other personal info that should not be shared publicly.  I'm therefore trying to figure out if it would be possible to redact or edit the mp3 recording, using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  If anyone reading this happens to have any suggestions, please send me a message via Keybase.

20191026T232912Z: was.<br>
20191026T212507Z: very dramatic last two days here.  Lucky to still be alive, thought I was going to have a heart attack.  I'm hereby publicly stating that I <s>am </s>was temporarily insane.  I believe it was psychosis related to the <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">MVA</a>.  Both times is was brought on by the same thing, but from two different female friends.  On two different days, in completely different enviornments/situations,  I had psychtic episodes where I screamed so loud that I damaged my vocal cords and now have a very hoarse, raspy voice, with burning (but gradually lessening) pain in my throat.  The only thing in common that sparked the two incidents was that the trigger for both was the same: the extremely rude pointing of a finger in my face while bitching about whatever.  I am non-violent.  Always have been.  Always will.  I am afraid that might accidentally change if anyone ever points their finger in my face close enough that I can reach out and break it off.  Knowing how uncontrollable these fits of rage are once they start, I am going to try to carry a stun gun and will use it against any aggressor in a situation where anyone's physical safety or their property is in danger, even if the aggressor is myself (I will zap myself to put myself just to protect others if I am in a psychotic rage).<br>
21091028T084451Z: yesterday I didn't have migraines like usual.  Took advantage of the moment by going to visit my kids.<br>
<span id="20191029T062729Z"></span>20191029T062729Z: somehow I stumbled upon <a href="https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342">this article</a> which intrigued me.  I left a comment on it, and that comment was approved and added to the bottom of the article by the time I fell asleep for a few hours, woke back up just now, and logged back in.  I figured what better place than here to record it.<br>
20191029T100919Z: sudomain <a href="https://carnivore.glencooper.com">carnivore.glencooper.com</a> is now working, via both http and https.  Currently I have it set up to auto-redirect to <a href="https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342">https://carnivoreaurelius.com/dopamine-fast/#comment-4342</a>.  Maybe someday I'll change that.  I already tried fasting but quickly realized how little self control I have... I couldn't resist the milky way minis sitting nearby, nor the twix.  Or the Dove dark chocolates.  Ugh.  FML.  Oh well.  Maybe if I had a steak before starting the fast I'll have more willpower.  Maybe next time.<br>

20191030T103553Z: my left knee has been very painful lately, moreso than usual.  I've gone thru 3 of the Lidocaine 5% patches already this week, one each day so far.  Probably because I freaked out so violently a few days ago and broke my cane, have been trying to hobble around without it.  I have my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULD5OQ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_xTwUDb0JJ95SN">Hugo Quad Cane</a>, but that thing is embrarrisingly huge, and is heavier than I'd prefer.  The cane I smashed during my last psychotic outbreak was a gift from a friend's father who has passed away, so that cane is irreplacable.  Doh.  Oops.  Damn.  I scare myself when I freak the fuck out.  I've noticed that the high humidity has been a factor every time it has happened.  As long as the power stays on and the dehumidifer stays going, I'm good.  My left knee only bends to 74.5° now.  (I measured: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wZZtqZIB7kpx4yTZAS5Bu08n1eoq0vN_">20191030T064648Z-knee.JPG</a>)<br>
20191030T151244Z: received a new medical insurance card in the mail.  Called CVS to ask that they refill the Emgality shot that they wouldn't give me last time I went because of a problem with the insurance.  Uploaded the new card using CVS app.  Hope this works.  If anyone wants to play a joke on a friend, you can tell them that CVS must have mixed up your phone number with theirs and they left a voicemail on your # by accident, then forward them this: <a href="https://cvs.glencooper.com">cvs.glencooper.com</a><br>
20191031T062921Z: made it to CVS earlier.  When I tried to pick up the Emgality shot, the pharmacist said there was a problem with my insurance.  I had the Medicare printout in hand that had my Medicare number on it, my new UnitedHealthcare Member ID card, and said I just spoke with UnitedHealthcare and my neurologist's office within the last few hours.  She went and made a call, came back and said it was definitely a no go.  I quickly became very frustrated and said I would pay out of pocket for it, no matter the cost.  She said it would cost about $600.<br>
20191101T091903Z I said fine, I'd pay it.  I don't have that much cash, but I have that much credit.  She acted shocked, said they couldn't let me pay that much... there was coupon online that and all I would need to do was get it and give it to them.  There was no cellular service inside the store, and they had no WiFi available.  The only public WiFi signal reachable was a nearby Starbucks, but when I tried to connect to that, it said something like "sorry, we're closed now, try using our WiFi again when we are open".  So I hobbled back outside, in humid enviornment where it was pouring rain.  I know humidity is one of my psychosis triggers.  I lost my shit, recorded myself screaming F*** YOU.  I'm not sure I said F*** YOU Big Pharma, but that's what I meant.  I got back into my friend's car and freaked out some more on her on the way home, saying I couldn't live like this anymore... I had to figure a way out.  It brought her to sobbing tears.<br>
20191101T091931Z: I'm now also fighting a cold, on top of the excruciating migraines.  I feel insane.  I'm trying really hard to NOT grind my teeth or bite down in a dangeously strong sneeeze.  I've been thru 3 boxes of tissues already fighting this beast of a cold.<br>
20191102T204139Z: figured out that CBD tinctures can be used to stave off migraines from reaching unbearable pain.  Thank you CBD.  FU Big Pharma<br>
20191103T215209Z: just got notification that CVS has also cut me off on the anti-depressant medication prescription that I was on.  I sure hope CBD can handle that too.  The way things are going, we might soon find out...

<span id="20191105T065519Z"></span>20191105T065519Z: woke up about 2 hours in excruciating screaming pain with muscle cramps/spasms in my left leg.  Nothing unusual about that, it's pretty much the daily norm since becoming disabled, oh the joys of being disabled.  That's not the point of this journal entry.  Before falling roughly 7 hours ago, the last thing I did was stumble upon <a href="https://bitclouds.sh/">https://bitclouds.sh</a>.  Tried it.  It worked.  Omg.  This is amazing.  Here's a current screenshot of what I'm seeing right now: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=103222wq-WdtINLxGA7hHejaSV7VG-O5X">https://drive.google.com/open?id=103222wq-WdtINLxGA7hHejaSV7VG-O5X</a>.  I joined the <a href="https://t.me/bitclouds">Bitclouds Telegram channel</a> and tried to add @BottlePayBot so I could tip people using BottlePay in that group, but got an error message: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FB2r99aHH3N-WNJMarwHxCiL6eyv0LO0">screenshot of error message</a> in Telegram group.

20191106T182556Z: My recent cold has been kicking my ass, keeping me in bed, busy wrestling with migraines.  Even tho the migraines are tolerable with the CBD, I found that I was still painfully sensitive to light.  Each lightbulb left on for even a second longer than absolutely necessary completely infuritated me.  I am miserable.  Now that I'm up and sitting in front of my laptop, I think I'll try to deal with this: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_g0fKDw7e9MARdBxCr6XYlkMOr4s_kJy">20191106T1823Z-CVS.PNG</a><br>

I'll need to initiate a fraud report with BitPay.  Here's the file I'm planning on sending them, a modified screenshot of the fraudulent charge which I edited and added my own notes to it: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RrHsdnJFKf7p6zXy7bi3lGBkQdSXUO_p">20191106T1928Z-Bitpay9758hacked.PNG</a>.

20191107T184441Z: a friend reminded me that I should try to follow up on the BitPay fraud problem.  I received this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P7_fVgnkQPk-Ybf4JrUZVi7pI3FW3cuo">VISA CARDHOLDER DISPUTE FORM.pdf</a> document that was emailed to me after calling BitPay support last night.  I was struggling with trying to figure out how to type in my details in the PDF document.  Finally I figured out that I could upload that PDF to <a href="https://dochub.com/">dochub.com</a> and edit it relatively easily there.  After I'd spent hours on wrestling with their stupid form, I reached <b>SECTION D. Additonal Information to include</b> and got stuck up again on a checkbox for "Police report (if applicable).  Note:  If transaction is unauthorized and the card was in your possession at the time of the unauthorized transaction, please provide a police report or your claim may be denied.", circled in red here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jVBE-u-qZIs_9cWOQk5Lbc0cF41fQshY">20191107T185902Z-screenshot.png</a>.  That's when I looked up the police department number for Long Beach, CA.  I found the phone number for them here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHqiJau0WQjHIRyJpDNd4arCMrige1Tk">20191107T184809Z-long_beach_police_department.png</a><br>
20191107T000657Z: Had another problem with BitPay.  Unable to meet their identity verification processes.  All of my legal mail and bank mail has been errorneously returned to sender for the last year by the USPS which has caused me an insane amount of trouble with any of these identity verification types of things.  Argh.  FML.  I hate banks.  I hate fiat.  I love bitcoin.  I love crypto.<br>
20191108T191331Z: finally finished filling out the incident report for the BitPay9758 fraudulent transaction.  Submitted to <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/Police_FiCOR">Financial Crimes Online Reporting (FiCOR)</a> at the website for Fairfax County Police.

20191109T181614Z: Completed filling out the VISA CARDHOLDER DISPUTE FORM.pdf document.  Note to self: need to FAX in that signed document.<br>
20191109T212848Z: faxed the complaint form.  took forever to fill out... (I'm SLLLLLOOOOWWWW, THANKS TO THE <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/">TBI</a>)<br>
