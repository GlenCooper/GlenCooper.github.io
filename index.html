20190403T0502Z: In every moment I start typing a journal entry, or add a pointcode within any code I write, I use the timestamp that occurred the very second I looked at my clock on my laptop.  I only go by Zulu time.  See <a href="https://timestamps.glencooper.com">timestamps.glencooper.com</a> for details.<br>
20190403T0617Z: I've been keeping a journal (in a MediaWiki) at <a href="https://recovery.glencooper.com/">https://recovery.glencooper.com</a> for a long time now.  It's just one problem after another with trying to maintain doing that in a provable way.  I've therefore made the decision to build a subdomain of "trust.glencooper.com" which will be set up with a CNAME DNS record pointing at GlenCooper.github.io.  I've already sent the DNS update to my hosting provider, and am currently awaiting the DNS change to propogate.<br>
20190403T0731Z: yay! looks like the DNS change has propogated: <a href="20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt">20190403T0730Z-yay_i_dig_it.txt</a><br>
20190403T0753Z: my vertigo is now at a 9 out of 10 scale.  I'm going to try to catch some sleep and hope that tomorrow's migraines won't be as unbearable as they've been the last few days.  I'll try to figure out what's going on with the subdomain trust.glencooper.com when I continue this after some sleep.<br>
20190403T0950Z: tried to get some sleep.  Tossed and turned for about an hour.  Was finally drifting off, almost into a deep sleep phase (thanks <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-smart-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8">Sleep Cycle app</a> for the analysis) when I was rudely awoken by a sudden whack of a pillow (or blanket?) by the person who was asleep in the bed next to me, whose name I am purposely omitting at this time, to protect the innocent.  It was an honest mistake.  That's not the point.  The point is; I'm back at the keys, forging onward.<br>
20190403T1039Z: installed <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> for the first time ever.  This line right here is the first time I've ever used the software, and I'm already wildly in love with it.  Goodbye vim and the wacky/problematic colorschemes that go along with it.  Hello <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1048Z: added git and github to atom.  Let's see if commits and pushes are any easier now...?<br>
20190403T1054Z: I need to go lay down for a few minutes.  Atom, you just blew my mind away.  How on earth could I not have found you until now?!  Where have you been all my life?  Thinking of all the time I've wasted wrestling with vim and code without you.  Ugh.  Wow.  Nice!!!  Suberb job, developers of <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>!<br>
20190403T1343Z: Got a short bit of sleep in.  Woke with a start, anxious to continue building on this page.  Successfully got the subdomain <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> working, but the https part is not functional yet.  The related Github message says: "Not yet available for your site because the certificate has not finished being issued.  Please allow 24 hours for this process to complete. (trust.glencooper.com)"<br>
20190403T1354Z: worth noting that my vertigo is noticably less after a nap.  I'm now off to battle trying to track down and log into each of my bank accounts to figure out the exact balances on each in order to reapply for food stamps (again!).  FML.<br>
20190403T1358Z: just after committing and pushing that last entry, I reloaded <a href="http://trust.glencooper.com">http://trust.glencooper.com</a> and noticed that it immediately/automatically updated to <a href="https://trust.glencooper.com">https://trust.glencooper.com</a>.  Sweet!<br>
20190403T1416Z: this is what got me going last night on setting up a public journal: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HBsL3hsT9wEo3LvDJy8BO6LVxXQHYob">20190402T2339Z-key_bank_password_reset_FAIL.png</a>.  A little background here: I missed another deadline on the most recent food stamps paperwork.  They wanted Unearned Income Payment Verification.  I tried to log into my first of several bank accounts to get a recent statement, and right off the bat I couldn't remember my first bank's password.  When I tried to do a password reset, I got the SMS text message successfully, but when I put it into their password reset thing on their website, it gave the error message of "We are unable to assist you with unlocking your user ID.  You will need to contact us at 1-800-539-1539".  That's when I decided that I've had enough of wrestling with the banks, trying to prove that I have no money left.... and they won't even let me do that.  Sigh.  I'm about to call that # now.  I will record the call, as I do ALL calls, since I can't remember what is said by the end of the call, or they'll say I remembered what was said incorrectly.  I need proof of every phonecall, and my solution to that is to record every call... for quality and training purposes only, of course.<br>
20190403T1432Z: since I despise using phones so much, I tried once more to do a password reset.  It worked.  I'm now logged into my <a href="https://www.key.com/">KeyBank</a> bank account.<br>
20190403T1524Z: saw that I recently paid $6.00 for a printed bank statement from my primary checking account at KeyBank.  I did that to test out whether or not USPS was delivering any of my mail here.  Found out USPS was returning all of my mail as "Undeliverable".  Got that sorted with USPS.  Now I need to go back to all of my banks and lawyers to have them resend the stuff that was errorneously returned as Undeliverable.  I called KeyBank and got them to send another printed statement, no charge this time around. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s_-6FPU59ccyxlI2NPIhc77FPX7Ltq2Y">call recorded</a>)<br>
20190403T2326Z: the vertigo won me over today.  It was so bad that I had to lay down.  When I did, I fell asleep.  Woke up hours later, feeling much better.  Checked on my SSDI application status.  It says "Status = Processing".  Continuing on trying to get my bank paperwork together to reapply for food stamps.<br>
20190404T2047Z: Migraines killed my productivity for today.  I stopped taking Advil because I've been dealing with an internal bleeding problem for the last month or so.  I'd rather bury my head in the pillows all day rather than deal with the... well... I will stop going on and on about the gruesome details of my many health issues in this public place.  Let's just say, I am alive, but am currently struggling with ongoing health issues.  I'm pondering ways to break up public vs. private.  I've heard that github has private repositories.  Maybe now would be a good time for me to look into that.<br>
20190405: responded to a cybercoders recruiter via email.  I'll find that and see if I can edit it and upload it here eventually.<br>
20190906T1414Z: migraines ongoing, but functional enough to at least update this wiki to say I'm still alive.  Warring with Social Security about them not being able to update an address of mine that appears on their Benefit Verification letter.  It's an address I moved out of over 20 years ago.  I've called them multiple times and even went into a local office in person already requesting they update it.  Each time it's always a different excuse they give why it's still not updated on their website yet.<br>
20190408T013238Z: I added a new button to my bookmarks toolbar in my firefox browser that that I can now just do one click, cut-and-paste, and then instantly have the current iso-8601 timestamp instantly created, and cut-and-pastable to whatever I want. Eventually I hope to make it so that a simple one-click will copy the value to the mouse buffer. The bookmark is linked to <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">timestamp.glencooper.com</a><br>
20190409T055336Z: spent the entire day organizing paperwork for my disability lawyers, and scheduling a doctor appointment with a specialist for an ongoing health issue I've been dealing with over the last month.  Winding down... calling it quits for tonight.  No progress made on anything glencooper.com related... only making this update because I'm super tired now and this is the kind of nonsense I do when I'm deleriously tired.<br>
20190409T171313Z: received a frustrating message from my primary doctor's office that they're unable to open the link that I spent a ton of time on putting together for them yesterday.  I put all of my medical data that I had from when I was in the hospital for 2 months onto 5 DVD ISOs, and made that info available in a single-click Google Drive link... and they say they can't open it.  So apparently they must not have internet access there... yet they're able to correspond to me via their internet-connected website portal... hmm.. re-thinking how to handle this latest drama.<br>
20190409T224144Z: figured out how to get my care summaries from the two hospitals I was in (in Charlottesville).  Got those uploaded to my current primary doctor's portal.<br>
20190410T145302Z: There's no indication that my care summaries were accepted or entered into my online portal with my doctor.  I guess I'll have to make hardcopies and bring them into the doctor's office.<br>
20190410T223820Z: made it to my doctor's office (via Uber).  Asked him to please fill out my SNAPET application for food stamps.  He did.<br>
20190410T223950Z: I thought about making yet another subdomain off of glencooper.com, something like fail.glencooper.com, but gave up on that idea because I don't really see what good could ever come from doing that.  I just wanted a way to document the unbelieveable things I'm seeing that are failing all around me.  Instead of wasting time building a site to document it, I'll just have to post the link to the shared file on Google Drive and hope that maybe someday someone might actually see this and this would be proof enough.  When I went to go upload my doctor's SNAPET application paperwork to https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/, their web app timed out on me.  Not a big deal, right?  I'm very slow now that I'm disabled, so I'm sure it's my fault.  Well this is what their page said when it timed out: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tRLtTwpXaVkHmGocadCNcUPkD4JIIkZ_">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tRLtTwpXaVkHmGocadCNcUPkD4JIIkZ_</a> I added the text in green.  Come on... really???<br>
20190411T060827Z: I'm kinda likin the <a href="https://timestamp.glencooper.com">https://timestamp.glencooper.com</a> bookmark.  I should see how hard it'd be to add a 1-click copy-to-buffer action would be...<br>
20190411T184903Z: wasted too much time trying to get it working to where I could simply one-click something on the page to get it to copy to buffer.<br>
20190412T235119Z: I think my next endeavor will be to build something where I can have a one-answer response to the most common question everyone asks me; "What have you been doing?", or "What do you do all day?".  The problem I have with that is, I don't recall.  I try to only think going forward, not looking back.  If someone wants to know what I've been doing, please don't waste my time asking me questions like that.  Ever since TBI, have a very difficult time remembering things, or some idiot liars will say I don't remember them correctly.  That's why I've chosen github to provably show my history and thought processes.  If you don't understand the things that you read about that I'm spending my time on, that's not my fault that you don't understand.  Learn about things like bitcoin.  Learn about things like <a href="https://lnd.glencooper.com">lnd.glencooper.com</a>.  Learn about things like coding.  Learn to code.  I believe The Lightning Network is going to guarantee that bitcoin (BTC) will always be the #1 cryptocurrency in the world.  I would be a multi-millionaire if I held onto any of the thousands of them I've had over the years instead of buying useless crap with them.<br>
20190413T231816Z: Continuing to struggle with health problems.  Not a whole lot to report on this front, except I have spent a fair amount of time on <a href="https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library">https://github.com/GlenCooper/glenbot2_library</a> today.  Ran into a problem and need to rethink how this would be possible to maintain security in an open-source fashion.<br>
20190417T035051Z: Hell is real.  I know this because I am living in it right now as I write this.  I've been in it for over two years now.  It will be 3 years exactly on July 22, 2019, see <a href="https://mva.glencooper.com">mva.glencooper.com</a>.  I'll never give up trying to code again.  I have yet to succeed.<br>
20190421T062719Z: just adding an update to say that I built (yet another) subdomain: <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>.  The idea behind it is that I have created bitcoin firstbits for several trusted friends and family members, and intend to give them the private keys to those addresses someday.  Of course private keys are meant to be always kept private, so by me having created those BTC firstbits addresses for them, therein lies the trust.  LOL... I just re-read that as I was typing it and chuckled at the absurdity of it all.  Bitcoin has taught me....... [15 minutes elapsed].  I'm tired.  I'm ending this here.<br>
20190421T152817Z: starting to listen to <a href="https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024">https://www.di.fm/shows/undercurrents/episodes/024</a> right now.  Having just lost half of another of my few remaining molars (while eating a hotdog), I need to shift my mental focus away from my health and dental woes, and see if I can do anything productive.<br>
20190423T024732Z: Sometime recently I threw together a logo for <a href="https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com">firstbits.trust.glencooper.com</a>, and captured a snapshot of it in the internet archive at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190423024528/https://firstbits.trust.glencooper.com/</a>.  Within the last 24 hours, I finally received some USPS mail at my current address.  Planning on using that mail as my proof of address until I can get a replacement DMV ID card.  Ordered one with my current address on it months ago, but the USPS returned the mailed ID card to DMV as Undeliverable.  I should follow up with DMV about the updated ID card.<br>
20190518T061905Z: Still struggling here.  Still alive.  Miserable.  I don't tolerate the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HYc3uXpz7Zmsvhw6qveq_9nAIdwx28_l">81% humidity</a> well at all.<br>
20190518T210539Z: had another problem with USPS again recently.<br>
